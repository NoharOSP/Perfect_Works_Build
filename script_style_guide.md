## Game Script Style Guide

### Numbers
- Amounts of things, measurements of time: 1-100 spelled out, 101+ as numerals (eg. three gates, twelve years, 500 years)
- Abbreviated, unabbreviated, or implicit measurements: always numerals (5 kph, 10 repsol per hour, 1000 sharls, incoming speed 120)
- Ages: always numerals (eg. aged 3, 7 years old, my son is 16)
- Money: always numerals (eg. 3000G)
- Game mechanics/counters: always numerals (eg. 2 AP, 3 Action Points, 1 HP)
- Percentages: always numerals (eg. 1%, 100%)
- Countdowns: always numerals (eg. 3...2...1..., commencing in 3...)
- Computer readouts: always numerals (eg you have 19 unread mails)
- Military divisions/buildings: always numerals/ordinals (3rd Fleet, 11th Development Base)
- Military manoeuvres/stages: always numerals (BattConn level 1, mark 3, pattern 10)
- Component/room/vehicle ID: always numerals (eg. torpedo tube 6, turret 2, bridge 3)

### Other
- "Double quotes around complete dialogue where the speaker is named". No quotes around dialogue where the speaker is not named.
- Single quotes for 'quoted' or 'emphasised' terms in the dialogue of ANY character.
- Key terms may be put in 'single quotes' when first introduced or explained. Once will usually be enough.
- Space after ellipses when at the end of a sentence... But no space when...the sentence continues like this.
- S-Stuttered words at the start of a sentence are capitalised before and after the dash, but otherwise n-not.
    - Before the dash, everything up to the first vowel of the stuttered word should be r-repeated, th-thanks.
- Asterisks around onomatopoeic words like \*huff\*, \*groan\*, but not around phonetics like argh, tch.
- Em dash with spaces for emphasis of explanatory clauses — this being one example.
- Parenthetical em dashes where — such as in this example — deemed suitable. Again include the spaces.
- Immediate em dash then a space for end of a line where someone is— Interrupted by themself or someone else.
- \- Dashes with spaces around headings for some computer readouts etc -
- Acronyms never have full stops, so DNA not D.N.A.
- Always okay, never OK or O.K.

### Notes
When inserting em dashes into the script txt files, they must be typed as a double dash inside angled brackets like so <-->
This is so that Xenolater will map them correctly to the font file.
