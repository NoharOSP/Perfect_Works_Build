There are three kinds in

'Handgun',
'Ether Gun',
and 'Big Gun'.<New>
Only the Handgun can be
swapped out for other
guns of the same kind.<New>
Power up a gun's attack
force by loading more
powerful ammo.<New>
To load ammo, press the
right or left directional
button at the Equip menu
screen.<New>
This will display a sub-
window in place of the
main Equip window, where
you can select the ammo.<New>
One thing you have to be
careful of is that the
number of bullets for
each gun is limited.<New>
To successfully manage
ammo, you must keep an
ample supply and reload
frequently.<New>
But, having said that,
note that Ether Guns do
not have such a limit.<Close><End of Block>
