There are three types of
guns that are standard
equipment for you...<New>
 Handgun,
 Ether Gun,
 Big Gun.<New>
The only gun that can be
re-equipped is the Handgun.<New>
You can power up guns by
upgrading their respective
'ammo' or 'bullets'.<New>
Equipping ammo is done by
pressing the left or right
directional button at the
equipment menu screen.<New>
Doing this will switch the
equipment window to a sub-
window where you can change
the type of ammo you use.<New>
There is one thing you have
to be careful of... There
is a only a finite amount
of each type of ammo!<New>
Hence, it is important to
keep an ample supply of
ammo in reserve and reload
as often as possible.<New>
The only exception to this
is the Ether Gun, which can
be shot an unlimited number
of times.<Close><End of Block>
