"Oh, is that it?
I guess what is done
is done...<New>
But jumping the gun is a
bad habit of yours.<Delay 10>
A king should always keep
calm and judge carefully!"<Close><End of Block>

By the way, I have
something to ask you..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:34 h:3>
Citan
"Oh?<Delay 10>
That is unusual."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Well, it's about this
warship we're on...<New>
...which is the same type
as the Yggdrasil.<New>
Years ago, my old man told
me it was scrapped because
the peace talks with Kislev
had made progress.<New>
So I knew of its
existence..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:30 h:4>
Citan
"Yes.<Delay 10>
Then what is
bothering you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:4>

It's not our royal crest!<Delay 10>
Look at this."<Close><End of Block>

"This is..."<Close><End of Block>

it looks like Shevat's."<Close><End of Block>

"Shevat?<Delay 10>
What the heck?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"This Yggdrasil was
probably not made by
your father.<New>
It has hidden potential
that would be unfathom-
able by the technological
standards of that time.<New>
Perhaps your father
feared that power and
so<Delay 10> sealed it away."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"Hmm, I see.<Delay 10>
So this may not have been
ours originally.<New>
If so, I wanna meet
the guys who made this
amazing baby."<Close><End of Block>

"Actually, they may
be closer than you
suspect..."<Close><End of Block>

"Huh?<Delay 5>
What did you say?"<Close><End of Block>

Sorry, it's my fault."<Close><End of Block>

I did not mean to...<New>
I am sure<Delay 10> they are fine."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"Though there's no proof to
back it up, I feel better
now that you said that...<New>
Even though I know you're
probably lying through your
teeth to make me feel less
worried..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"No, it was nothing...<Delay 10>
Now, I do think you should
apologize to Rico.<New>
You may get more than a
bruise this time, though."<Close><End of Block>

"Yeah."<Close><End of Block>

Come again.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:54 h:3>
Oh, Bart!
Thank you for letting me
ride on your Yggdrasil!<New>
I've always wanted to ride
it... It's OK. The children
are safe in Nisan's care!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:48 h:3>
I heard there was a
shortage of people so I
decided to participate!<Delay 10><New>
Actually, I got fed up
with my job in the small
hideout...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:40 h:2>
What do you wanna do
with your Gear?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:36 h:2>
You must come back
now, ya hear!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:22 h:1>
Come again!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:44 h:4>
If something should
happen, I'll go too!
That's the spirit of
Yggdrasil Gear troops!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:48 h:4>
I no longer have a place
in Gear combat, but I'd
better be ready for it
anyway!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:52 h:5>
I'll go buy parts for the
Gears.<Delay 10> General Maitreya'll
be upset if we don't try 
to put another Gear unit
together.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:48 h:4>
Hey, you haven't seen
Maria's Gear, have you?<New>
It's too big to fit in
this hangar, so it's on
the deck.<New>
Speaking of which...<New>
Do you wanna change the 
name of <Seibzehn>?
    <Opcode 1 255>Yeah, why not!?
    No, not now...<Close><End of Block>

General Maitreya,
Falkon and Farrant
are gone.<Delay 10>
...I miss them.<Close><End of Block>

We don't have enough
underwater equipment,
Gears, or pilots.<Delay 10>
I'm glad you're here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:54 h:3>
When I come here at night I
sometimes hear Maitreya and
them talking and laughing.<New>
But when I get closer, the
voices disappear.<Delay 10> I'm sure
they are lonely,<Delay 10> too.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:44 h:4>
Maitreya spoke highly
of you <--><Delay 10> I heard your
dives and zooms are
flawless.<New>
Do you think you
can train me on
my next watch?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:52 h:3>
Now, I must ready the Gear
parts.<Delay 10> Maitreya's strict
with this sort of thing.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:46 h:3>
That Gear with the
slender build withstood
<Brigandier>'s whip?<New>
What kind of armor did
they cover it with?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:62 h:4>
Hey? Did you see this month's
edition of Gear Fan magazine?<Delay 10>
It says 'hovering is all the
rage right now'!<New>
Until a while back, that took
special equipment that only the
young master had equipped on
his Gear!<Close><End of Block>
