you were in the Gear.<New>
But even if you hadn't,
people would have died...<Delay 10>
Right?<Delay 10>
You weren't the reason.<New>
War...<Delay 10>no, the people

the reason.<New>
And unless you get rid of

Right now there is no
other way so I have to
fight...<Delay 10> But that doesn't

the kids in your village.<New>

don't you have to fight?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:50 h:4>

"You do have a reason to

fight. <New>
But as long as you ignore

never forgive you.<New>
Just remember that."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:48 h:4>
Bart
"And another thing,<New>
I'm not saying that not
helping me is running

You don't have to help.<Delay 10>
This is my own problem.<Delay 10>
I don't wanna get you in

But,<Delay 10> if I had your skill

He knows that."<Close><End of Block>

"And why, you may

It's because of the

It must be difficult
