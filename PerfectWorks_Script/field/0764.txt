Would it have been better

Sure, maybe what happened

getting in the Gear.<New>
But there were going to be

hadn't...<Delay 10>most likely.<Delay 10>
You weren't the cause.<New>
War...<Delay 10> No, the people

Right now there is no
other way, so I have to
fight...<Delay 10> But that doesn't

the kids in your village.<New>

want to harm others.<New>
But if you want to make
it up to those children,<Delay 10>
don't you have to fight?"<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"You do have a reason to
fight.<Delay 10> A reason you MUST
fight.<New>
But as long as you ignore

never forgive you.<New>
Just remember that."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:48 h:4>
Bart
"And another thing:<New>
I'm not saying that not
helping me is running
away.<Delay 10> You don't have to

This is my own problem.<Delay 10>
I don't wanna get you
involved against your

But<Delay 10> if I had your skill

Did I just imagine it?<Close><End of Block>

He knows that."<Close><End of Block>

"And why, you may

It's because of the

It must be difficult
