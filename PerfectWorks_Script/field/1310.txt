"Elly, that is not
the case.<New>
You cannot blame your-
self for having been
manipulated by post-
hypnotic suggestion.<New>
More importantly, you
saved Fei. If it
had not been for your
efforts back there,<New>
Fei would not have been

Carl. Is that not
correct?"<Close><End of Block>

here we may disturb

It looks like Fei's

longer."<Close><End of Block>

It will make Fei feel

saying..."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"Elly, you're
wrong.<New>
You were being
manipulated by
post-hypnotic
suggestion.<New>
You don't need to
feel guilty.
Besides, in the end
you saved Fei.<New>
You protected him
from Ramsus back
there. Right?"<Close><End of Block>

Don't fret over it.<New>
And if you hadn't been

battle, Ramsus woulda
killed Fei."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Even if it was impossible 
to resist the effects,<New>
it's because I was off my
guard that I got hypnotized

I'm partly responsible for

So I'd like to be by his
side till he's awake."<Close><End of Block>

Those men in black are

You seem to be better.
I'm glad. I'm really glad.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:46 h:4>
Has he recovered?
His treatment was a
success, so there's no
need to worry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:54 h:4>
The patient hasn't regained
consciousness yet,<New>
but we could find no
particular abnormalities
in his brain tissue.<New>
It was most fortunate
that his metabolic rate
had dropped due to the
low water temperature.<New>
One false move and I fear
the brain tissue would have
necrotized, leaving him
with permanent damage.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:58 h:4>
Yes. You can set your minds
at ease.<Delay 15> For the time being,
we need to perform a
thorough examination.<New>
But once we've finished, your
ship's medical facilities
will be sufficient for any
further treatment.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:50 h:4>
His remaining unconscious
goes hand in hand with
the physical exhaustion.<New>
It's the toll taken on
his body that keeps him
asleep. He will need a
few more days to recover.<New>
It's alright,
he will wake up.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:36 h:3>
Not at all. Just
doing my job as a
churchman.<Close><End of Block>

Hello, everyone.
His treatment is finished.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:52 h:3>
Unfortunately, the patient
hasn't come to yet.<Delay 10> But
there's no need to worry.<New>
When he recovers
physically, he'll also
regain consciousness.<New>
It's fine for you to take
him to your ship now.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:36 h:3>
Not at all. Just
doing my job as a
churchman.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:48 h:4>
Oh yes, Brother Billy.
He went back to the
orphanage. The children
there are in his care.<Close><Close><End of Block>
