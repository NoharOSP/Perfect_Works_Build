I'd like to thank him..."<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Then..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Elly, that is not
true. You cannot resist
being hypnotized.<New>
More importantly,
you saved Fei.<New>
Fei could not have
been protected from
Carl without you.
Is that not correct?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"Well, we do not want to 
disturb his recovery.
So, shall we go now?<New>
It may take a little 
longer to finish 
treating Fei."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"I agree.
Fei will feel at ease
that way. Please let us<New>
know when you finish
treating Fei.
We will leave the rest
up to you."<Close><End of Block>

bothered you."<Close><End of Block>

"We are in Billy's debt.
We should go thank him."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:3>

"First of all, let us move
Fei to the Yggdrasil.<New>
It will not be too late to
go see Billy afterwards."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:18 h:2>
Citan
"Then..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Elly, that is not
the case.<New>
You cannot blame your-
self for having been
manipulated by post-
hypnotic suggestion.<New>
More importantly, you
saved Fei. If it
had not been for your
efforts back there,<New>
Fei would not have been
safeguarded against
Carl. Is that not
correct?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:40 h:4>
Citan
"Well, by being
here we may disturb
the examination,<New>
so let us take our
leave.<New>
It looks like Fei's
treatment is going
to take a little
longer."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"That would be fine.
It will make Fei feel
safer.<New>
Alright, please let
us know when Fei's
treatment is finished.<New>
We will leave the rest
up to you."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:30 h:3>

Bart
"So you're
saying..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:38 h:4>
Bart
"Elly, you're
wrong.<New>
You were being
manipulated by
post-hypnotic
suggestion.<New>
You don't need to
feel guilty.
Besides, in the end
you saved Fei.<New>
You protected him
from Ramsus back
there. Right?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"Hey, we don't want to
disturb his recovery.
Let's take a little walk.<New>
It looks like Fei's
treatment is going to
take a bit longer."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:52 h:4>
Bart
"Yeah, you do that.
Fei would surely be glad.<New>
Alright, call on us when
Fei's treatment is
finished. I'll leave
the rest to you."<Close><End of Block>

consciousness?"<Close><End of Block>

"Thanks a lot,
Doctor!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:36 h:4>

"I have to admit
Billy has helped
us out a lot.<New>
I guess we should
thank him or
something."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:52 h:4>

"First, let's take Fei to 
the Yggdrasil. We can go 
thank Billy afterwards."<Close><End of Block>

Rico
"Hmm, so..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:48 h:4>
Rico
"Back then you'd lost
your own will 'cause
of the hypnosis.<New>
Don't fret over it.<New>
And if you hadn't been
there in the underwater
battle, Ramsus woulda
killed Fei."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:48 h:4>
Rico
"It looks like Fei's
treatment is gonna take
a bit longer.<New>
Let's kill some time
elsewhere for now."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:48 h:4>
Rico
"Do what you need to do.<Delay 20>
When Fei's treatment is
done let us know."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:24 h:2>

fixed up?"<Close><End of Block>

the time."<Close><End of Block>

thanks to Billy."<Close><End of Block>

the Yggdrasil. And we can
take it from there."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Even if it was impossible 
to resist the effects,<New>
it's because I was off my
guard that I got hypnotized
in the first place.<New>
I'm partly responsible for
what happened.
So I'd like to be by his
side till he's awake."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:22 h:3>
Elly
"Fei<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
I'm sorry."<Close><End of Block>

consciousness,<Delay 10> won't
he?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:46 h:3>
Elly
"<Delay 15>...<Delay 15>I'm sorry, Fei.<New>
It's all because I
caused the engine room
to go haywire..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:28 h:2>
Elly
"Thank you..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:40 h:4>

Is that okay?"<Close><End of Block>

Billy
"How is he?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:36 h:3>
Billy
"All we can do is 
wait and see."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:52 h:3>
He is in stable condition.
His treatment is almost 
complete.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:48 h:4>
W, what's happening?<Delay 15>
Those men in black are
killing the Church
people indiscriminately!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:52 h:2>
You seem to be better.
I'm glad. I'm really glad.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:46 h:4>
Has he recovered?
His treatment was a 
success, so there's no 
need to worry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:54 h:4>
The patient hasn't regained
consciousness yet,<New>
but we could find no
particular abnormalities
in his brain tissue.<New>
It was most fortunate
that his metabolic rate
had dropped due to the
low water temperature.<New>
One false move and I fear
the brain tissue would have
necrotized, leaving him 
with permanent damage.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:58 h:4>
Yes. You can set your minds
at ease.<Delay 15> For the time being,
we need to perform a
thorough examination.<New>
But once we've finished, your
ship's medical facilities
will be sufficient for any
further treatment.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:50 h:4>
His remaining unconscious
goes hand in hand with
the physical exhaustion.<New>
It's the toll taken on
his body that keeps him
asleep. He will need a
few more days to recover.<New>
It's alright,
he will wake up.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:36 h:3>
Not at all. Just
doing my job as a 
churchman.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:52 h:2>
Hello, everyone.
His treatment is finished.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:52 h:3>
Unfortunately, the patient
hasn't come to yet.<Delay 10> But
there's no need to worry.<New>
When he recovers
physically, he'll also
regain consciousness.<New>
It's fine for you to take
him to your ship now.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:38 h:3>
Please don't worry.
I did my job as a 
clergyman.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:48 h:4>
Oh yes, Brother Billy.
He went back to the
orphanage. The children
there are in his care.<Close><Close><End of Block>
