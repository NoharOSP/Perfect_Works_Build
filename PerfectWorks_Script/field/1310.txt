Elly

<TextBlock 45 w:46 h:4>
Has he recovered?
His treatment was a 
success, so there's no 
need to worry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:54 h:4>
The patient hasn't regained
consciousness yet,
but we see no abnormality
with his brain.<New>
The low water temperature
lowered his metabolism and
saved him.<New>
One false step and he
would have suffered 
from brain death.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:54 h:3>
Yes, don't worry.<Delay 15>
However, we need to conduct
more tests for a while.<New>
After that, he can be
treated at your medical
facilities.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:50 h:4>
The reason why he hasn't
regained consciousness is
physical exhaustion.
He overworked himself. <New>
It'll probably take him a
few more days, but don't
worry, he'll wake up.<Close><End of Block>

Hello, everyone.
His treatment is finished.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:56 h:4>
Unfortunately, the patient
hasn't regained
consciousness yet. But
there's no need to worry.<New>
When he recovers physically,
he'll also regain
consciousness. You can
take him to your ship now.<Close><End of Block>

Please don't worry.
I did my job as a

He was worried about the
