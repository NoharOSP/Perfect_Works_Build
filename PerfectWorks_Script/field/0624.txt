Barkeep
"Here's a tip, Fei.
Be very cautious of
alcohol and women.<New>
Behind those sweet and
beautiful appearances
lies a deep, dark swamp.<New>
Before you realize it,
you are trapped, and
lose your freedom.<New>
They are the most
fearsome demons
in this world."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 9 w:44 h:5>
Hmmm...!!<Delay 20>
Young one, beware!
I can see it...<New>
There is a dark and
icy wind that blows
where you are going.<New>
A wind that nurtures
grief and resentment,
inviting death from
which there is no
salvation...<New>
No one will be able
to escape from it!
But you, and only you,
must eventually face
up to that dark wind!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:38 h:3>

I've always wanted
to try saying that!<New>
Did I scare you?<Delay 10>
I'm really sorry!
Wahaha...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:52 h:4>
But in reality, these
premonitions of misfortune
tend to take on their own
shape once uttered.<New>
You ought to be
prepared...<New>
... Hah hah! Just kidding!<Delay 20>
It's also a joke!<Delay 20>
Don't let it get to you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:40 h:4>
Instead of believing
what others say, you
should follow your
own path.<New>
After all, your
fate will be what
you make of it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:48 h:4>
But, do you want to hear
my prediction again? Eh?<Delay 20>
    Yeah, from the top!

Oh good!
That's the spirit!
Well, here goes...<Delay 20>
Are you ready?<Close><End of Block>

A guy like you will
never be popular.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:38 h:4>
Gramps always makes
things out to be
easier than they
really are!<New>
It's actually quite
a tremendous feat
to get through that
Blackmoon Forest...<New>
All those dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
live there...<New>
I tell you, it's
better if you don't
go near the place!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:52 h:5>
South of here is the
'Blackmoon Forest'.
If you can make it through
there, you'll come to Av,
the great land of fire!<New>
I shouldn't be wasting my
time here in this little
country village.
Why, I oughta go to Av
and work there...!<New>
Beautiful women and good
liquor...<Delay 15>
And if I work hard enough,
I'll be rich in no time!<New>
Hehehe...
Wouldn't that be good!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:44 h:4>
Pay no attention to
the fool!
He's always saying all
this carefree stuff.<New>
In reality, it's an
incredibly hard task
to get through the
Blackmoon Forest...<New>
Lots of dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
make their home there!<New>
It'd be better for
you to stay away
from there!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:52 h:5>
If you get through the
'Blackmoon Forest' to
the south of here, you
will find the kingdom of
fire, 'Av'.<New>
Instead of just wasting
away here in this little
mountain village, I should
go have some fun in Av!<New>
Beautiful girls, tasty
liquor...<Delay 15>
Why, a gentleman like
myself is bound to draw
the babes wherever I go!<New>
Haw-haw-haw...
Wouldn't that be good!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:48 h:4>
Have you heard the
latest rumors!?<New>
It's said that, in the
southern desert of Av
there is buried treasure
all over the place!<New>
There's hundreds of
people who are trying
to strike it rich by
digging everywhere!<New>
A single strike could 
make you totally rich.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:42 h:3>
But then again, you
never can tell how
much is the truth...<New>
In life, if it sounds
too good to be true,
it usually is. Bah.<Close><End of Block>

Since we both hate each
other, why don't you just
leave me alone then, eh?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:46 h:3>
Shut up!

How could there be a
mermaid in the middle
of the sea of sand?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:50 h:4>
What's this, Fei?
You've never seen
the sea of sand?<New>
This is what the
sea of sand is...
It's a vast, swirling,
bottomless desert.<New>
More than half the world

I'm surprised you haven't
heard anything about it.<Close><Close><End of Block>
