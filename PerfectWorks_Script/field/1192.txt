It's unusual for you

<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:5>
This is <Weltall>.
Height 16.3 sharls
Base Weight 17.8 kahnns
Full Weight 22.7 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
A well balanced Gear in
offensive, defensive,
and Ether abilities.<New>
But it has some parts that
cannot be disassembled...
I guess you can call them
'blackboxes'...?<New>
They don't cause problems
in maintenance, but they
just get on my mind every
time that I see them.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:42 h:1>
This is <Weltall-2>.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
This is <Xenogears>.
It is Fei's Gear.<New>
Height 19.8 sharls
Base Weight 18.9 kahnns
Full Weight 21.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
<Weltall-2> was
transformed after its
contact with Zohar.<New>
Detailed specs cannot be
ascertained by the
measuring devices here.<New>
But then again, I wonder
whether this Gear has a
limited ability to measure
at all?<New>
It almost seems that this
Gear gets stronger and
stronger as Fei's mental
powers increase...<New>
Anyhow, the engine seems
to have been left in there
from before, so it should
require fuel as before...<New>
But it wouldn't surprise
me if this thing doesn't
actually need fuel anymore!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:5>
This is <Brigandier>,
our boss, the young
master's Gear.<New>
Height 17.0 sharls
Base Weight 13.9 kahnns
Full Weight 18.6 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
It is specially tuned for
desert battles. The power
of the Hover-thrusters in
the legs are especially
worthy of attention...<New>
Oh, and the eyepatch and
feather decorations were
added later at the young
master's request.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:6>
We didn't know what to do
when young master said,<Delay 10>
"Destroy one sensor and

ability to reconnoiter..."!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:58 h:4>
This is <Andvari>,
the young master's Gear...<New>
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
This is an Omnigear that
was left by Roni Fatima,
the ancestor of our young
master...<New>
They say this Omnigear was
created by uniting that...
Anima Vessel (or whatever it
is called...) and a machine.<New>
But by the looks of it, this
frame also used to be some
kind of Gear before it was
transformed...<New>
All exterior work and 60% of
the interior was changed to
unknown materials, but the
base was a regular machine.<New>
So that means the basic
performance can be improved
by using different parts.<New>
But then again, it moves by
spiritual power so such parts
may not influence its real
overall power that much.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:56 h:5>
This is <Andvari>,
the young master's Gear...<New>
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior...<New>
They made it using the data
on the Omnigear left by Roni
Fatima, an ancestor of the
young master, and the data
obtained from <Xenogears>.<New>
It is a combination of the
latest Gear technology and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.<New>
Even when it was found
hidden in the underground
in Nisan, its basic weapon
equipment was the whip.<New>
That must mean, the young
master's ancestors must've
used whips and rods too...
I guess it's in the blood,
huh!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:56 h:4>
This is <Heimdal>,
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.<New>
Height 16.9 sharls
Base Weight 14.0 kahnns
Full Weight 18.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
The basic frame was
excavated at the same time
as the young master's Gear.<New>
But its output was
proportionately too powerful
for the body, so it took a
long time to adjust it...<New>
Actually many of my team
members were injured
because of it.<New>
But Doc solved the problem
so easily, and can control
it so well now...
It was just amazing.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:54 h:4>
This is <Fenrir>,
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.<New>
Height 18.6 sharls
Base Weight 17.2 kahnns
Full Weight 20.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.<New>
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior.<New>
They used the data from the
Omnigear, Fenrir, brought
from Solaris by the doctor,
and Fei's <Xenogears>.<New>
It is a union of Gear and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.<New>
The default equipment is
the sword...which seems
to be the doctor's weapon
of choice.<Close><End of Block>
