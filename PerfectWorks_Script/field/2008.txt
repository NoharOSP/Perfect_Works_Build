I'm a celebrated Gear
weapons specialist...<Delay 20>
But lately there's been
no interesting work...<New>
There are no men with
enough guts to ask me
to forge them a weapon
to fight Deus...<New>
If you bring me a nifty
sword, I can forge it into
something truly amazing
for you, anytime...<New>
But I won't work for
anyone rude enough
to ask me to check a
weapon while it's still
equipped to their Gear!<Close><End of Block>
