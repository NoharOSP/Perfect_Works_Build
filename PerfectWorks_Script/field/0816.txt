"First, Fei and I will
prepare for the Tournament
at the arena.<New>
When the Tournament starts,
Bart will enter the water-
way through the well and
head for the castle.<New>
If you swim against the
current you should reach
the castle.<New>
I am certain there will
still be some guards
there, so please dispose
of them quietly.<New>
We will make a good show
at the Tournament to draw
the guards' attention for
as long as possible.<New>
During that time, you can
rescue Margie.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:42 h:3>
Any questions?"

Bart
"It's already started.
If something's wrong now,
then that's tough!<New>
What're you worried about?
Fei'll do fine.
Besides, Citan's with him,
too.<New>
Now, all I gotta do is
sneak into the castle
via the well.
No problem."<Close><End of Block>

Citan. They're going to
help rescue Margie."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:52 h:4>
Thank you for coming here
in this desert heat.
I am a servant of the
Nisan Sect.<New>
Ever since Shakhan took
Mother Marguerite, I've
been looking into ways
to get her back.<New>
I've been trying to find
out where she is being
held,<New>
listening to workers
talk about the comings
and goings at the castle,<New>
and giving food to the
guards who are preparing
for the Tournament, to
loosen their lips too.<New>
Yesterday, I finally got
some information...
Margie's in the citadel.<New>
The problem is how to
slip into the castle...<New>
I thought about it a lot,
but it looks pretty bleak.
I'm sorry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:50 h:3>
Bart
"No big deal. At least
we know where she is now.<New>
You just relax, we'll
find a way to slip into
the castle."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:54 h:3>
My apologies. If there
is anything else I can do
to help just ask...<New>
Do you have any good leads?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:38 h:2>
Did you find a way
into the castle?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:40 h:2>
Did you find a way
to use the festival?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:40 h:2>
Any new information?
Good ideas?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:32 h:2>
Any luck finding
the well key?<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"Yeah, the old guy next
to the well had it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:44 h:3>
Citan
"Not yet. We are going
to look for it again."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:44 h:4>
Bart
"Not yet. Right now
we're gonna hit the
streets for info.<New>
We'll think about the
rest later."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:50 h:4>
I see. I'm very relieved
that you are all here.
Please come see me again
if you hear anything new.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"I just remembered where
Breidablik's water supply
comes from...<New>
Spring water rises up from
under the castle and flows
to the town via a series
of underground waterways.<New>
We can sneak into the
castle by going through
these underground
waterways.<New>
We can get into them from
the town's well. The water-
ways should lead right up
to the castle's reservoir.<New>
If we are able to get that
far, we should be able to
sneak into the other rooms
of the castle from there."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"A good idea, but I have
one further suggestion.<New>
There is a festival going
on now. There must be a
way we can use it to our
advantage."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:2 h:1>
!<Opcode 2 30><Close><End of Block>

North of town is a
plaza. The castle is
beyond that.<New>
I'm sure you'll find
something there.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Tomorrow is the
Tournament. There will
be betting at the arena.<New>
Surely the soldiers' minds
will be on the Tournament
more than on their job.<New>
We must use this to our
advantage."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:34 h:1>
What do you mean?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:44 h:4>
Citan
"Fei will participate.
We will have him put
on a big show there."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Tomorrow's the Tournament.<New>
Nothing's more popular than
gambling at these things.<New>
All the guards will be
placing bets.<New>
They'll be more interested
in the fight than their
jobs. We gotta use this.
Fei! You've gotta fight!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:20 h:2>
Fei
"Huh? Me?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Everyone would know me.
Besides, I know the castle
well so I should sneak in."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:46 h:4>
I'm sure today's the
last day to sign up for
the Tournament. You'd
better register soon.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:48 h:3>
Citan
"No need to worry.
Fei already registered."<Close><End of Block>

how will you actually get
into the castle?"<Close><End of Block>

info.<Delay 30> I'm sure we'll get a
good idea from somewhere."<Close><End of Block>

"Very well.<New>
If we get any good ideas
we will meet back here and
plan our strategy."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 57 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Tomorrow, Fei will be in
the Tournament at Fatima
Castle.<New>
We will put on a good show
to distract the guards.<New>
Then Bart will infiltrate
the castle through the
underground waterways
by way of the well.<New>
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 58 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"Well, then...<New>
Fei is in the Tournament.
He will draw the guards'
attention.<New>
Then Bart will enter the
castle through the
waterways via the well.<New>
After that he will rescue
Marguerite from the
citadel.<New>
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will
also help work the crowd

We are free to do what we
like for now.
Let us have a look around
