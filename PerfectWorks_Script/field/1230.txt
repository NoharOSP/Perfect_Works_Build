Fei
"It's alright. I was just
as bad.<New>
We hadn't seen each other
in ages, and the first
thing we do is..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"Heh,<Delay 5> yeah...<New>
The Yggdrasil II was put
together in a hurry and
the depth charge setup
isn't exactly great.<New>
And, well, I guess it
was my fault that prep
of the depth charges
got delayed,<New>
because I prioritized
equipping the Bart Bombs
over...<Delay 10>
...everything else."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:28 h:2>
Fei
"Bart Bombs?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:36 h:4>

um, well,<Delay 20> that's
not important."<Close><End of Block>

Anyway, I'm glad you're
okay.<New>
I always knew that you'd
be alive."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:52 h:4>
Bart
"Of course.
You'd be a fool to doubt
Bart the Immortal!<New>
...At least, that's what
I'd like to say here, but
just recently things got
pretty hairy.<New>
I got totally reamed by
a red Gear monster."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:30 h:2>
Fei
"A red Gear..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Yeah. He beat me and then
left us to sink into the
sand.<New>
But this next part sounds
wild.<Delay 10> The bottom of the
desert is a huge, open
cavern.<New>
Guess what else was sunk
there!
A submarine that looked
just like the Yggdrasil!<New>
So we transplanted the
bridge and other service-
able parts into that and
remodeled it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"I found it a truly
unbelievable tale myself,<New>
but although it certainly
is identical in appearance
there is now the potential
to move through water.<New>
Perhaps this and the
Yggdrasil are sister
prototypes?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:48 h:4>
Bart
"There are signs people
had been living there,
apparently long ago.<New>
Weapons all over the
place.<New>
We have those people to
thank for the remodel
turning out so well."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:52 h:4>

"Upon inspection, it seems
likely the weapons Bart
showed me belonged to...<New>
Shevat."<Close><End of Block>

The country that flies
