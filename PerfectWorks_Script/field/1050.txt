You're not limited to just
the <X> and <S> button's
physical attacks!<New>
There is another attack form

"One weakness that I can see
from watching your bout is 
that you seem to use your 
'Ether Bullets' too much.<New>
You should better understand
the nature of the attack...
'Ether Bullets' raise your
'Heat Gauge (H.G.)' by quite
a large percentage.<New>
Three shots will easily send
your H.G. to the MAX 
condition. If you continue 
to attack in that condition,
your machine overheats.<New>
The excess heat begins to
cause damage, so if you
don't take care, your HP

"The main cause of your loss
is this: your over-reliance
on 'Dash' movement! Simply
put, you run round too much!<New>
Dashing about may be a good
strategy but you'll notice
that the 'Heat Gauge (H.G.)'
which shows your Gear's heat
level, climbs much faster!<New>
You can continue to DASH
even after your H.G. reaches
the MAX condition, but as 
your Gear overheats more and
more, it will cause damage!<Close>
If you don't take care, then
your H.P. will fall to zero,

'Dash' and 'Ether Bullets'!"<Close><End of Block>

Receptionist
"There are two reasons for
your loss. First, your over-
reliance on the 'R1 button'
to shoot 'Ether bullets'.<New>
'Ether Bullets' are useful
when your foe is far away,
but using them too much will
cause problems with your own
Gear's heat level!<New>
Second is your over-use of
'Dash movement'. The use of
either of these when your
'Heat Gauge' is at MAX will
cause your Gear to overheat!<New>
Whilever your overheating,
you will be taking damage,
so if you're not careful,
before you know it, your 
H.P. will fall to zero!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 382 w:52 h:4>

"The point is the over-use
of either ability is bad 
for your Gear!<New>

your heat during battle.
