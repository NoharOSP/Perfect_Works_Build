What is this place...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:58 h:3>
...Nowhere that concerns you.<Delay 5>
Has he only called you in
here for his own sake...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:42 h:4>
This is the inside of
the shell that is our
base personality,<Delay 5> the
room of 'the coward'.<New>
You must've been here
many times.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:42 h:2>
Yes... 
I remember...<New>
I'm pretty sure I was
here in my dreams...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:50 h:5>
Everything despised and
unwanted, he pushed onto
me, while he shut himself
away in his own shell...<Delay 5>
The coward 'Fei'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:40 h:2>
The personality that
was our foundation.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:48 h:2>
Who are you?
...Oh yeah. You're my...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:46 h:3>
Hey, let's watch this
together! It's my most
treasured possession...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:50 h:5>
Hmph.<Delay 10> This is how, over
and over again, he plays
back the time when he was
full of happiness, and
exists within that time.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:52 h:2>
While I only get to exist
within the leftover dregs.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:44 h:2>
I'll show it to you...
'everything' about me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:54 h:5>
He pushed all the bad
things onto me,<Delay 5> and only
the memories filled with
happiness and Mother's love
did he keep for himself.<New>
And then he shut himself
away forever with those
memories, inside his own
shell.<Delay 10> That place is here.<New>
The scene before our
eyes is what he made.<Delay 10>
He's just clinging on
to that memory.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:14 h:1>
This<Delay5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:32 h:3>
Stop it!<Delay 5>
Enough already!<New>
Is this it,<Delay 5> are
these scenes all
there is to us?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:42 h:4>
It's too much!<Delay 5>
There's nothing here!<Delay 5>
A world full of such
deception and pain...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:50 h:2>
Well, too bad.<Delay 10>
This is our everything...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:36 h:2>
No!<Delay 5>
Get out!<New>
This is my room!<New>
I thought you'd
always be with me!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:58 h:3>
Why won't you try 
to see reality!? <New>
The good things, the bad
things,<Delay 5> aren't they parts
that make up the whole!?<New>
Why won't you show him, too!?<Delay 5>
Why won't you show Id what
you're always watching!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:38 h:3>
No!<Delay 5>
That's mine!<New>
I won't show it to
the likes of him <-->
he killed Mom!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:40 h:3>
Look who's talking.<Delay 5>
Aren't you the one
who did the killing?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:48 h:4>
No!<Delay 5> I'm not a killer!<Delay 5>
It was you who killed
Mom!<Delay 5> I'd never harm her!<New>
Mom wouldn't pay
attention to you,<Delay 5>
and Dad didn't notice,
so you<--><New>
So I'd never harm her!<Delay 5>
I'd never harm her!<Delay 5>
I'd never<--><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:46 h:1>
This stops right here!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:46 h:4>
...It was 'us' who
killed Mom.<Delay 5> No one
else is to blame.<New>
It's not because she
became Myyah or because
Dad didn't notice.<New>
Don't look elsewhere
for a cause.<Delay 5> Don't put
the responsibility on
anyone but yourself.<New>
Sure, maybe Mom was
Myyah.<Delay 5> I know that
the days you went
through were tough.<New>
It'd be unbearable
for anyone.<New>
But that doesn't mean
you can push it onto
Id alone!<New>
We are all one person.<Delay 5>
We must become one.<Delay 5>
Right, Fei...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:50 h:3>
Now, walk on your own two
feet.<Delay 5> Face the reality
you don't want to see.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:46 h:3>
Show them to Id.<Delay 5>
The things you've been
keeping for yourself...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:46 h:3>
It's a lie!<Delay 5> That woman!<Delay 5>
This scene,<Delay 5> it's an
illusion he's made up!<New>
I,<Delay 5> my reason for being,<Delay 5>
will not be swayed by
such a trick!<New>
I...!<Delay 5>
I...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:36 h:4>
Id<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>enough.<Delay 5>
We wouldn't solve
anything by trying
to trick you.<New>
Mom saved us
in the end.<Delay 5>
That's the truth.<Delay 5>
Right?<New>
The reality isn't
all grim, Id...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:48 h:4>
My...<Delay 5> My power
couldn't save anyone.<Delay 5>
It only destroyed.<New>
I believed that I would
only be able to identify
with others by bringing
destruction upon them.<New>
So I had no choice but
to destroy it all...<Delay 10>
People...<Delay 5> The world...<Delay 20>
Even Elly...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:48 h:4>
But that's not the case.<New>
Just as Mom, despite
being Myyah, saved us...<New>
our power can save
people...<Delay 5>save Elly.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:40 h:3>
...That's a first.<Delay 10>
To think that Mother
could be so warm...<New>
To me...<Delay 5>
she almost seems...<Delay 5>
too warm...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:52 h:4>
Fei.<Delay 5>
I will give you the
memories that I have.<New>
Thus, you will know.<Delay 5>
How we've lived until now.<Delay 5>
What we are.<Delay 5>
And what we must become.<New>
Our true unification
is not yet complete.<Close><Close><End of Block>
