It's gotten awfully cold.<Delay 20>
I hate the cold!
It's killing me...<New>
If the temperature keeps
dropping like this, we'll
all be frozen before Deus
can finish us off.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:52 h:4>
Us people of Shevat have
always dreamed of coming
down to live on the
planet's surface...<New>
But we didn't ever imagine
this would be how we would
realize that dream!<Delay 20>
...This is unbearable!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:52 h:5>
Though this base is the
last refuge for humans...<Delay 20>
as you can no doubt see we
have almost no supplies.<New>
Anyway, we're using a
fallen piece of Shevat
as the main base...<Delay 20>
But you probably could
have guessed that, huh.<New>
If we can take out Deus
even one day sooner...<Delay 20>
We can't hold out much
longer like this.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:56 h:5>
Av, Kislev, Nisan...
We've been feuding for such
a long time, but finally we
are coming together as one
like this...<New>
But it's probably already
too late...<Delay 20>
It's always the case.
By the time we notice 
anything, it's way too late.<New>
How could we possibly
stand up to god's army?<Delay 20>
The situation's
really hopeless.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:4>
So many have died...<Delay 20>
If this continues,
even more will die.<New>
It's the same as 500 years

hardship is being repeated
again...<New>
What's going to happen
to our world...<Delay 20>
What's going to happen
to us...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:50 h:3>

whole world...!<New>
My home, my whole family,
everything's been
destroyed by them...<New>
Who cares anymore,
burn it all up!!
Hahahaha...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:50 h:3>
It's not like we're
born just to die...?<New>
What's going to
happen to us now? <Delay 20>
To this world...<New>
We can't carry on without
at least drinking...<Delay 20>
It's scary and lonely...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:44 h:2>
Did you say you still
needed something else?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:44 h:3>
Hey buddy, did you
need something?<New>
If you need something
come talk to me at the
counter.<New>
I have to make things
really clear or else
it gets on my nerves.<Close><End of Block>

give you a better deal.<Delay 20>

money back!<Delay 20> They ran away
after I sold them to you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:54 h:3>

cute?<Delay 20> They're going 'cheap,
cheap' too! How about it?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:46 h:3>
Wanna buy my Picotiels?<Delay 20>
