Loooong long ago, the

The <Chu-Chu> tribe and

A dreamy, sweet existence.<New>
But one day, a huuuge red
fireball rained down from

guardian god as he was
asleep.<Delay 20> Blam, kablam, boom!<New>

That's a lot of work.<Delay 20>
Even the older generations
of the <Chu-Chu>s don't
know many things about it.<Close><End of Block>

couldn't escape and were
killed...<Delay 20> Those guys ate

But I heard people on the
land are all scary.<Delay 20>
They lie, say awful
things, hurt and kill
each other...<Close><End of Block>
