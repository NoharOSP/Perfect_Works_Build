A reactor that cannot be
controlled by man is just
like a double-edged sword.
We will hurt even ourselves.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:60 h:5>
In the northern part of the
Capital, in the industrial
block lies a relic from an
ancient civilization...
a giant 'reactor'.<New>
That reactor produces power
beyond our ability to control.
It's something man will
never be able to wield...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:64 h:4>
It's become apparent that the
primary target in the attack
on the Empire was to bomb that
reactor in the industrial block.<New>
If<Delay 5> they had a direct hit on the
reactor<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>the entire Capital
would've been turned to ashes.<New>
It would've been a hell on
earth<Delay 5> where no living thing
could exist."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:44 h:4>
There's been some
information that
suggests Av is doing
something suspicious.<New>
This balance we've 
had with them isn't
going to last<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:50 h:5>
During the assault on the
Empire, it was said that
the new imperial Gear was
stolen from the D-Block
area's Gear dock<Delay 5>...<New>
I happened to hear from
the higher-ups that it
was apparently the same
Gear stolen earlier by an
Av infiltration squad.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:52 h:4>
Just a while ago I was
pretty active in the
Battling tournament.<New>
Then those people from the
Committee scouted me out.
Heh, it's good to be a
soldier.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:44 h:5>
My Gear was primarily
customized for ground
combat and they used
that to assign me to
the rescue unit.<New>
Although I wasn't able
to fight in my Gear,
it's a pretty good
feeling knowing my job
is saving people.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:56 h:5>
For today's lecture we will
discuss the movement of
Gears on the world map.<New>
I understand that most of
you are ex-Battlers and are
well acquainted with Gears,
but it should be no loss for
you to re-learn the basics.<New>
First, the limits to the
area of movement of Gears...<Delay 5>
It is impossible to walk
through dense forests in
a Gear!<New>
Instead of being hasty, just
press the L2 and R2 buttons
simultaneously and you will
all get off your Gears.<New>
Once you pass through the
forest, you may once again
get on your Gears! That is
all for this lecture...<Delay 5>
Any questions?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:44 h:4>
<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>If there are no
questions, class is
dismissed.<Delay 15> Oh yes, I
forgot one thing...<New>
This is common sense,<Delay 5>
but movement over
water is not possible.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:48 h:3>
Whew,<Delay 5> it was another
wonderful lecture today.
I'm even awed at myself.<New>
<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>I'm sure looking
forward to tomorrow's 
lecture.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:54 h:4>
Hmm,<Delay 5> I noticed you were all
diligently listening to my
lecture.<New>
Now don't forget,<Delay 15> getting
on and off your Gears is
done by pressing the L2 and
R2 buttons simultaneously!!<Close><End of Block>

Battler Soldier
"The lecture's about to begin.
Although it's short, it's such
a bother. Please don't talk
to me right now."<Close><End of Block>

Battler Soldier
"The officer's lecture is
always the same<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>It's
hard on us people who
have to listen to him.<New>
Not just that,<Delay 5> he keeps
adding to the rules,
regulations and control
of activities.<New>
I wish I could go back to
my days as a Battler."<Close><End of Block>

Amazon Soldier
"Shut up,<Delay 5> I'm trying to
listen so quit talking
to me."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:5>
Amazon Soldier
"Argh,<Delay 5> this sucks.<Delay 15> He
thinks it's a lecture<Delay 5> but
all he does is say the
same thing everyday.<New>
Compared to this, I was
fighting a lot more in my
Battling days.<New>
Now that was living.
Maybe I should quit the
military..."<Close><End of Block>

Army Cook
"Patriotism is a necessary
component to drafting many
young soldiers.<New>
But because of that, we get
some young ones that over do
it. By the time that happens,
it's usually too late<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>"<Close><End of Block>

Army Cook
"I'm the cook for the
Imperial barracks.
I can get in trouble for
having you guys in here.<New>
If you have no business
here, please leave.
Moreover, you aren't
even soldiers.<New>
I thought that I told
them strictly not to
allow civilians in.<New>
Man...what am I going
to do."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:48 h:4>
Argh!<Delay 5> I failed<Delay 5> again.<Delay 15>
Hmmm,<Delay 5> there's just
something not right with
the special sauce.<New>
Ether cuisine has a lot
of depth to it.<Close><End of Block>

Failure is an important
step to my path to success!<Delay 15>
It's my dream to become
just like that first Ether
cook over in D Block.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:46 h:4>
<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>I volunteered so
that I could protect my
country<Delay 5>...<Delay 5> But this<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
I didn't join for this.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>
I'm a new recruit for the
Kislev military. I just
graduated from the Imperial
officer school as an elite!<New>
So, why did they put me in
A Block working under the
chief cook?<Close><Close><End of Block>
