If Billy says it you

Bart
"Listen very carefully!<New>
That Limiter is implanted
in our bodies.<New>
Right now,
this research facility
is the only place where
we can get them removed!<New>
Citan misled Karellen and
the other guys and brought
us in here to remove the
Limiter!"<Close><End of Block>

You did remove Fei's

Let's get out of here!"<Close><End of Block>

Let me handle Fei and

Bart isn't lying,
Citan is the one

<TextBlock 30 w:54 h:4>
Billy
"There's no Limiter?
Isn't that because Elly is 
from Solaris?"<Close><End of Block>

If we mess up here,
I put those guys who went

Karellen's private
research lab as planned.<New>
We'll meet up at
the rendezvous point."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"That is not the only
reason why I brought
you here.<New>
Those who want to
become independent
from Solaris<New>
must know the actual
situation and
its true form.<New>
Who is doing what and why."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Ostensibly,<New>
I received a covert
order from the Emperor
to get in contact<New>
with the one who 
possesses the fleshly 
body the Council so 
desires.... <New>
and if possible bring
the body back.<New>
That was my duty.
As a result, I had no
choice but to deceive you.
Please forgive me."<Close><End of Block>

"Besides,<New>
I myself had
a matter that had be
verified in this
facility..."<Close><End of Block>

we escape from here.<New>
It is something you must

Y...yes, of course...
That is..."<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Elly was taken to
Karellen's research lab.
It could not be stopped.<New>
I am sorry."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"I do not know...<New>
But one thing bothers
me...<New>
When Karellen took Elly,
I had a chance to acquire
Elly's cellular
information.<New>
I analyzed it and found
something very interesting
...Excuse me, I mean...
unusual.<New>
There is no 
Limiter implanted in her."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Even Solaris citizens
have a Limiter implanted
when they are born.<New>
There are exceptions for
certain people like myself
and Ramsus,<New>
whose Limiters can be
removed later on through
the treatment such as the
one I did for Bart.<New>
But you must
have permission from the
Ministry to do so."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"There must be more to it
than that. I don't know
the reason,<New>
but Karellen is so
absorbed by her data."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"There is still something
left to be done. I will go
destroy the last gate."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Oh, yes! By the way, young
one, about the effects of
removing the Limiter...<New>
The results will not show
up that quickly. Already
your physical Limiters have
been removed naturally.<New>
The part I have removed is
the psychological section.<New>
That is...the subconscious
fear and veneration for the
Ministry and the emperor
have been removed.<New>
Basically, you will be able
to battle against them
without any fears or
hesitations.<New>
It is not that you have
suddenly become more
powerful."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"...Yes.
Yui gave it to me as
I was leaving.<New>
I used to use it before
I met her.<Delay 10> For a long time
I vowed not to use it for
killing though.<New>
But now is not the time to
contemplate morals. It is
not fair for me to be the
only 'innocent' one."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:12 h:2>

"Yes?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:48 h:3>

I am sorry, forgive me."<Close><Close><End of Block>
