That day, 500 years ago,
that woman was definitely
here...<Delay 20> She had no choice
but to be a captive...<New>
We could've won, at the
cost of many sacrifices!<Delay 20>
If only that traitor
hadn't disappeared with
the woman!!<New>
The escaped woman freed the
beast. The beast sucked
human blood and ate their
flesh...<Delay 20>
And tore the world apart...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:52 h:5>
Excuse me, miss...<Delay 20>
You resemble the girl who
was like an angel, and
was sacrificed in the
great war...<New>
I can still picture the
confusion of Zephyr and
her followers.<Delay 20><New>
They were the ones who
were actually responsible
for the death of Sophia.<New>
In truth, we are still
being punished for that
crime 500 years ago!<Delay 20>
It feels almost
ridiculous, hahah...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:52 h:5>
Since then, people have
found themselves groping
in the dark.<Delay 20>
They've been atoning for a
crime for 500 years...<New>
I want to you to be
careful, young one. Don't
follow the same path as
the traitor...<Delay 20>drowning in
hatred and love...<Close><Close><End of Block>
