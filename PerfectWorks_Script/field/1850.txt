There, the people seeking
absolution for their
limited lifespan argued
amongst themselves over
who had priority.<New>
An ugly dispute,
to cling to life...
So it may have appeared
to onlookers...<New>
But to me, this <-->
desperately trying to
survive <--> was the
'natural human form'
of every one of us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:50 h:6>
The 'haves' and the
'have-nots' were there...<Delay 90>
 
And...<Delay 10>
my former comrades from
Solaris were there too...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:50 h:9>
They badly needed our
flesh and blood.
They told us that the
'haves' must share
with the 'have-nots'.<Delay 60>
 
And they asked if
'haves' like us could
understand their agony...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:56 h:9>
I couldn't answer...<Delay 60>
 
No matter what I said, 
they would have heard it as
the arrogance of a 'have'...<Delay 60>
 
Nevertheless, if their agony
could be healed...<Delay 10>I was
determined to do so...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:54 h:3>
Just as I had been in
the dream-memory...<Delay 60>
in the distant past...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:62 h:7>
Then, the System suddenly
went out of control.
One giant lifeform in mid-
amalgamation <--> a 'Meld' <-->
broke through the barrier
of the generation equipment
and appeared before us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:58 h:8>
That thing that was once
human but had lost its
human form...<Delay 10>began eating
the people who happened to
be there seeking salvation...<New>
We had no choice but
to fight...
To save those people...
Indeed, to save 'him'...<New>
Because those eyes <--> the
eyes of that thing that
was once human <--> pleaded
to us...<Delay 10> For death rather
than agony...<Close><End of Block>

"This facility was built
for the Solaris Ministry's
ludicrous plan.<New>
A facility to turn
poor mutated people into

One part of their bid

"Yes, if you go under
their umbrella of
protection now,<New>
maybe you can avoid
absolute death.<Delay 10>
But is that any way
for a person to live?<New>
What meaning is there in
living just yourself
alone, heartless, and
feeding on other people?"<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Everyone wants to
be loved, to be
needed by someone,<New>
so we seek other people...<New>
It's lonely to be on your
own, so we get close to
one another to live...<Delay 10>
That's who we are...<New>
That's how people
have survived.<Delay 10> You
can't clap with only
one hand, right?"<Close><End of Block>

your agony,<New>
I'll give however much

human...<New>
Don't let go of your
human heart..."<Close><End of Block>

"I just did what I could.<New>
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
A privileged 'have'...<New>
Maybe it's pity for
the 'have-nots'...<New>
But if I can know the
joy of sharing the life
within me little by
little like this,<New>
then someday it'll be
possible for people to
truly offer their love
to others...<New>
I believe that people
can do it.<Delay 30> So..."<Close><End of Block>
