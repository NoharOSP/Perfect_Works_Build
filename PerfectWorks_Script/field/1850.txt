There, humans fought
amongst themselves
greedily for limited
pardons to live.<New>
It was an ugly battle
to keep on living.
Or so it may have seemed
to the casual passerby...<New>
But to me they were
desperately trying to live.
It was each person's
'natural human form'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:46 h:5>
There were the 'haves'
and the 'have-nots'...<Delay 90>
And...among them...
were some of my former
friends from Solaris...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:48 h:8>
They wanted our flesh
and blood. They told us,
the 'haves' should share
with the 'have-nots'.<Delay 60>
 
They asked if a 'have',
such as myself could
understand their pain...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:56 h:9>
I couldn't answer...<Delay 60>
 
No matter what I said it
would have sounded like a
conceited 'have' speaking...<Delay 60>
 
Even so, I wanted to
relieve their anguish...
And I decided to do so.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:54 h:3>
Just like the person in the
memory of my dreams...<Delay 60>
in the distant past...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:62 h:7>
Then suddenly the System went
out of control!
The 'Sphar Mass', a monstrous
organism still in the process
of amalgamation, broke through
the barrier of the life-support
facilities and stood before us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:58 h:8>
No longer of human form...
that which was once human
began eating the people
gathered there seeking
relief...<New>
We had to fight it...
In order to save the people
and in order to save 'him'...
 
The eyes of that which was
once human looked at me,
pleading for<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>death<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
to take away the agony.<Close><End of Block>

"This facility was built
by the Solaris Ministry...<New>
It was created to implement
their 'no waste' plan.<New>
Such facilities were to
convert mutated humans

tools for their ambitions.<New>
Just one part of their
overall plan of racial
purification."<Close><End of Block>

"Of course, once you
enter their umbrella
of protection...<New>
...you can avoid
absolute death.
But is that human life?<New>
Even if you are the only
one left, if you're
devoid of a heart,
what does it all mean?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"All of you, want to be
loved...needed by someone,
so we look to others...<New>
By ourselves, we are
lonely, so we try to
draw close together to
live...<New>
That's what it means to
be human...
That's how people live.<New>
A single hand cannot
clap."<Close><End of Block>

"To relieve your pain,
I'll give however much

Therefore...<Delay 30>

Don't let go of your

Elly
"I only did what I could.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
A well-to-do 'have'.<New>
Maybe it's only pity for
the 'have nots'...<New>
But if I can know the joy
of giving out a little of
the life within me...<New>
Then maybe someday it may
just be possible that one
human can truly give love
to another...<New>
People can do it...
I truly believe they can.
That's why..."<Close><End of Block>
