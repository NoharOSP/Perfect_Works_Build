"What!?<Delay 20>
Collecting combat data!?<New>
Then this war that's
lasted for hundreds of
years on the Ignis
continent...<New>
It was just a farce
plotted by Solaris!?"<Close><End of Block>

The Limiters constrain the
Lambs' abilities. But there
may be a way to undo that.<New>
Torah Melchior used to be
one of the three sages of
Shevat.<New>
He must know a way to
negate the Limiters.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:5>
The scientists of Solaris,
disgusted at the rebellion
of the land dwellers 500
years ago, decided to do a
little work on them.<New>
They tampered with people's
genes, applying various
seals, called 'Limiters',
so that they would never
again be able to revolt.<New>
For the past 500 years,
Solaris has controlled
the Lambs' consciousness,
behavior, everything.<New>
Naturally, the Lambs don't
know anything about it.<Delay 20>
That makes it even more
unforgivable!!<Delay 20> Although
it's highly efficient...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:6>
The surface is a testing
ground for Solaris.<Delay 20>
Their objectives are
genetic engineering,
crossbreeding, and mind
control...<New>
They want to collect data
for the newly created 
organisms and general 
combat data.<New>
Lambs are mere livestock
to be raised for Solaris'
purposes.<Delay 20>
The Church was
established mainly to
manage the Lambs.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:5>
It's not a farce.<Delay 20>
To them, it's an important
simulation under tight
restrictions.<New>
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the Vessels
of Anima is one of their
primary objectives.<New>
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.<Close><End of Block>

They're not doing this
for fun, either.<Delay 20>
It's an important

In any case, the Lambs will

You land dwellers better
think seriously about it.<Delay 20>
The Lambs'll continue to
be Solaris' guinea pigs

<TextBlock 12 w:56 h:4>
The whereabouts of the three
sages, Melchior, Balthasar
and Gaspar have not been
known since the Great War.<New>
There's even a rumor that
they lost faith in humans
because of the tragedy in
Nisan.<New>
Solaris' activities have
increased once again...<Delay 20>
I wonder where they are
and what they're up to.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:52 h:4>
A man named Karellen was
the mastermind behind
applying Limiters to the
Lambs.<New>
He was originally a Lamb.
He learned molecular
engineering from the sage
Melchior himself.<New>
But he misused it for
such a terrible act!<Delay 20>
An unbelievable monster!<Close><Close><End of Block>
