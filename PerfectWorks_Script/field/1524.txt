"What!?<Delay 20>
Collecting combat data!?<New>
Then, this war that's
lasted for hundreds of
years on the Ignas
continent...<New>
It was just a farce 
plotted by Solaris!?"<Close><End of Block>

The Limiter restrains the
Lambs' abilities. But there
may be a way to remove it.<New>
Torah Melchior, he used
to be one of the three 
sages of Shevat.<New>
He must know a way to
remove the Limiter.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:5>
The scientists of Solaris
had bitter experiences in
the revolt by the Lambs
500 years ago. <New>
So they decided to do
some work on the Lambs.<Delay 20>
They inserted various
Limiters so that they would
never be able to revolt.<New>
For the past 500 years,
Solaris controlled the
Lambs' consciousness,
behavior and all.<New>
Naturally, Lambs don't
know anything about it.<Delay 20>
That makes it even more
unforgivable!!<Delay 20> Although
it's highly efficient...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:6>
This land is a testing
ground for Solaris.<Delay 20>
Their objectives are
genetic engineering,
crossbreeding, and mind
control...<New>
They want to collect data
for the newly created 
organisms and general 
combat data.<New>
Lambs are mere livestock
to be raised for Solaris'
purposes.<Delay 20>
The Church was
established mainly to
control the Lambs.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:5>
It's not a farce.<Delay 20>
To them, it's an important
simulation under strict
restrictions.<New>
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
Anima Vessels is one of
their important objectives.<New>
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:54 h:5>
They're not doing this
for fun, either.<Delay 20>
It's an important
simulation.<New>
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.<New>
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:52 h:5>
You land dwellers better
think seriously about it.<Delay 20>
The Lambs'll continue to
be Solaris' guinea pigs
unless someone stops them.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:56 h:4>
The whereabouts of the three
sages, Melchior, Balthasar
and Gaspar have not been
known since the great war.<New>
There's even a rumor that
they lost faith in humans
because of the tragedy in
Nisan.<New>
Solaris' activities have
increased once again...<Delay 20>
I wonder where they are
and what they're up to.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:52 h:4>
A man named Krelian was
the mastermind behind
the planting of the
Limiter in the Lambs.<New>
He was originally a Lamb.
He learned molecular
engineering from the sage,
Melchior, personally.<New>
But he misused it for
such a terrible act!<Delay 20>
An unbelievable monster!<Close><Close><End of Block>
