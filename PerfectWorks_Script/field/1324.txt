Citan
"If the Church is indeed
under the control of
Solaris, as we suspect...<New>
...then there should be
something in here that
would prove their
connection to each other.<New>
We should go on further
and see if we can find
any more clues."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 102 w:40 h:4>
Citan
"I am sure of it.<Delay 30>
This has to be the
Church data bank."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 103 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"I say...<Delay 5> A facility
like this would be hard
to find even in Solaris.<New>
Why would the Church
have such a setup?"<Close><End of Block>

"Hmm<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
the plot thickens<Delay 5>..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 105 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Here is a relatively
recent record<Delay 5>...<New>
It, too, indicates that
there has been a large
number of people sent
to Solaris<Delay 5>...<New>
The majority of them were
people who had come to the
Church seeking help or
spiritual salvation."<Close><End of Block>

your answer..."<Close><End of Block>

"The 44th Salvage Plan?<New>
Isn't that what the
Captain of the Tamuz
was talking about?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 110 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"This is the only plan
that is not linked to
Solaris...<New>
It must have been
initiated by the Church
itself, as a completely
independent project.<New>
It commenced about...
nineteen years ago.<Delay 10>
Allow me to display
the data..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 111 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"So, from this, it appears
that under Aqvi lies an
ultra-ancient civilization.<New>
They have been doing a huge
number of test digs and
obtained a vast quantity of
resources from the ruins.<New>
Biological weapons<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
nuclear weapons<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
Hmm<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>I see, so this must
be their intention<Delay 5>...<New>
My assessment of the
situation would be that the
Church is attempting to
break away from Solaris<Delay 5>...<New>
And once freed from its
master,<Delay 5> it is likely to
attempt<Delay 5> world domination<Delay 5>
on its own."<Close><End of Block>

attempt world domination<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
That's kinda ambitious!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 113 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Indeed, but looking at how
the Church has not reported
these results,<New>
or even the existence of
the site, their true
intentions are quite
obvious...<New>
The Church is planning
to revolt by monopolizing
this ultra-advanced
civilization's resources!<New>
Alas, such a ploy would
not be uncommon."<Close><End of Block>

"Yes, that is probably it.<New>
Shall we move along? There
could be more to find yet!"<Close><End of Block>

that Solaris was behind
the Church?<New>

this case."<Close><End of Block>

We might be able to

Wait one moment<Delay 5>..."<Close><End of Block>

Now I am able to redirect

The Church is really a
