We should go on further

any more clues."<Close><End of Block>

This has to be the

Why would the Church

the plot thickens<Delay 5>..."<Close><End of Block>

"Here is a relatively
recent record<Delay 5>...<New>
It, too, indicates that
there has been a large
number of people sent
to Solaris<Delay 5>...<New>
The majority of them were
people who had come to the

spiritual salvation."<Close><End of Block>

"This is the only plan
that is not linked to
Solaris...<New>
It must have been
initiated by the Church

It commenced about...
nineteen years ago.<Delay 10>
Allow me to display
the data..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 111 w:54 h:4>

"So, from this, it appears

obtained a vast quantity of
resources from the ruins.<New>
Biological weapons<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
reactive weapons<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
Hmm<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>I see, so this must
be their intention<Delay 5>...<New>
My assessment of the
situation would be that the
Church is attempting to
break away from Solaris<Delay 5>...<New>
And once freed from its
master,<Delay 5> it is likely to
attempt<Delay 5> world domination<Delay 5>
on its own."<Close><End of Block>

"Indeed, but looking at how
the Church has not reported
these results,<New>
or even the existence of
the site, their true
intentions are quite
obvious...<New>
The Church is planning
to revolt by monopolizing
this ultra-advanced
civilization's resources!<New>
Alas, such a ploy would
not be uncommon."<Close><End of Block>
