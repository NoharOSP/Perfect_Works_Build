"I just heard about
it from Doc.<Delay 10>
Id, huh...?<New>
...Who would've thought
that within me there's
another me...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:46 h:3>
Fei
"They say I'm the
second advent of Grahf,<New>
who at one time laid
waste to the whole
world...<New>
Apparently Grahf was
once a land dweller
named Lacan..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:46 h:4>
Fei
"A while back, Grahf
called me the Slayer
of God.<New>
And now...
I have a feeling I know
what those words meant.<New>
If Id's power is in
any way comparable to
Grahf's, then...<Delay 10>I..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"If we did that,
you'd be<-->"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"Thank you, Elly.<Delay 10>
But no.<New>
There's no guarantee
Id won't appear just
because I leave the
battlefield.<New>
Besides...
I tried to kill you...
You're quite calm,
even despite that?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:18 h:2>
Fei
"Elly..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:42 h:4>
Elly
"But the Fei in front
of me is the same Fei
I've always known.<New>
You're back to the
way you should be.
Don't worry too much
about it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:42 h:4>
Elly
"They don't know what
they're saying!<New>
With your power right
before their eyes,
those people are
just in a panic!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:38 h:3>
Elly
"Shall we escape?<New>
If it's Grahf or
the battlefield
that draw Id out,<New>
shall we both go to
a place where there
are no wars?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:44 h:4>
Elly
"That's alright...<Delay 20>
I already have nowhere
to go back to..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"If you'd been seriously
trying to kill me,<New>
you surely would've
succeeded, right?<New>
The power of Id, the
other you, is on a whole
other level, after all.<New>
And yet you didn't
go through with it.
You avoided me at
the last second.<New>
Couldn't it have been the
will of the current you
that made you miss?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"And...even if you do
get taken over by Id<New>
and make enemies of all
those around you...<New>
I'll still be by your side.
...Because...<Delay 30>
Because...<Delay 20>it's lonely to
be on your own."<Close><End of Block>

"I'll open it now.<Delay 20>
Let's go, Fei."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:56 h:5>
This is where we keep the
criminals in their cells.<Delay 20>
It's been said that
soldiers from Solaris were
locked up in here long ago.<New>
I've heard that even we did
many atrocious things at
that time.<Delay 20>
War is like that. We forget
what's good and what's bad.<New>
One betrays friends,
neighbors, even his own
flesh and blood...<Delay 20>
War turns even good, kind
humans into crazed monsters.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:6>
This is a Carbonite Cage
that petrifies humans
alive.<Delay 20> Even if it was
only used on criminals,
it is still heinous.<New>
No matter how you look at
it, they've sure thought
of cruel things.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:46 h:4>
By the way, d'you land
dwellers know about the
Nisan tragedy during
the Great War?<New>
Did you hear anything
from the higher ups?<Delay 10>
<Opcode 1 255>    Yes
    No<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:50 h:4>
I'm surprised they told
you. In that case, what
more can I say?<New>
Don't believe everything
those old men say.<Delay 20>
Nothing good will come
of it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:48 h:4>
I doubt they told you.
Those old men politely
avoid talking about it.<New>
Do they think the truth
will disappear if they
turn away from the past?<Delay 20>
Bunch of fools!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:54 h:4>
Be careful, land dweller.
You'll have a terrible time
if you put your trust in
those old men.<New>
Just like the people from
Nisan did, 500 years ago...<Close><Close><End of Block>
