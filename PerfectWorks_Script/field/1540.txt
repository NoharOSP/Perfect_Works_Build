Id...<New>

Fei
"They say I'm the second
advent of Grahf.<New>
The one who destroyed all
of this world...<New>
It seems Grahf was once
a land dweller named
Lacan..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"Grahf called me the one
who would destroy God<New>
In a way, I can
understand what he means
now.<New>
Though my Id power isn't
good enough, if it has
the same quality as
Grahf's...I..."<Close><End of Block>

"If you did that, 
you'd be..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:46 h:4>
Fei
"Thanks Elly, but no.<New>
Even if I left the
battle field, there's
no guarantee that Id'll
never appear again.<New>
Besides...
I tried to kill you...
You're still okay with
that?"<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"Elly...
Thank you."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"But you're the same Fei
I've always known.<New>
You've returned to your 
old self. Please don't 
be obsessed with it."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"They're not thinking
about what they're
saying!<New>
They're just confused by
your powers!"<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Let's escape.<New>
If Grahf, or the war
brings out Id, let's
go to a place where
no wars exist."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"That's alright...<Delay 20>
I don't have a place to
go back, either..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"Then you could've killed
me if you really wanted
to, right?<New>
The other you, Id's power
is nothing like that.<Delay 20>
But you still didn't go
through with it.<New>
You knew when it was
enough. Isn't that
because your will was in
effect?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"If you're to be controlled
by Id and all those around
you became your enemies...<New>
I'd still be by your side.
...Because...<Delay 30>
Because...<Delay 20>I know it's
lonely to be by yourself."<Close><End of Block>

Let's go, Fei."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:56 h:5>
This is where we keep the
criminals in their cells.<Delay 20>
It's been said that
soldiers from Solaris were
locked up in here long ago.<New>
I've heard that even we did
many atrocious things at
that time.<Delay 20>
War is like that. We forget
what's good and what's bad.<New>
One betrays friends,
neighbors, even his own
flesh and blood...<Delay 20>
War turns even good, kind
humans into crazed monsters.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:6>
This is a Carbonite Cage
that petrifies humans
alive.<Delay 20> Even if it was
only used on criminals,
it is still heinous.<New>
No matter how you look at
it, they've sure thought
of cruel things.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:46 h:4>
By the way, d'you land
dwellers know about the
Nisan tragedy during
the great war?<New>
Did you hear anything
from the higher ups?
<Opcode 1 255>    Yes
    No<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:50 h:4>
I'm surprised they told
you. In that case, what
more can I say?<New>
Don't believe everything
those old men say.<Delay 20>
Nothing good will come
of it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:48 h:4>
I doubt they told you.
Those old men politely
avoid talking about it.<New>
Do they think the truth
will disappear if they
turn away from the past?<Delay 20>
Bunch of fools!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:54 h:4>
Be careful, land dweller.
You'll have a terrible time
if you put your trust in
those old men.<New>
Just like the people from
Nisan did, 500 years ago...<Close><Close><End of Block>
