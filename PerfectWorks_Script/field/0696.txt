"Wow...
So this is The Church
of the Ethos workshop,<New>
eh, doc?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:56 h:4>
Citan
"Yes. The Church's workshops
are the only places that
officially repair Gears.<New>
Let us see if we can get
the parts we need to fix
<Weltall> here.<New>
As they say, time is money!
...So we should do whatever
we can do as soon as we are
able to."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:50 h:3>
Citan
"Sorry to bother you.<New>
Our Gear has broken down,
so I would like to buy
some parts to fix it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Yes, we are hoping to
replace an X-29 model
injection bypass circuit."<Close><End of Block>

"I see.
Sorry to have
bothered you."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:52 h:4>
These days the 'Ethos'
technology has become
indispensable in people's
day-to-day lives.<New>
We thought we'd use these 
left over facilites and 
try and help everyone as 
much as we can.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:58 h:3>
You two again?<New>
As you can see, this facility
is for the repair of worker
Gears only.<New>
We simply can't help you out
with the new model military
Gear that you have.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:60 h:4>
This town was orginally a
haven for treasure hunters
searching the ruins.<New>
Our workshop can hardly keep
up with the demand for repairs
on the worker Gears used in
the excavation of the ruins.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:40 h:2>
Huh?
How can we help you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:50 h:3>
Tough luck, huh?
Can you tell me what make
of parts you are after?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:48 h:4>
X-29 model injection
circuit?<New>
That's only used on the
latest military models.
We don't keep those kind
of parts in stock here.<New>
You can only get such
special parts by placing
an order at the Church
headquarters.<New>
This workshop is only
for the repair of
civilian Gears...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:30 h:2>
Sorry that we
can't help you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:44 h:2>
Please don't touch it.
It's being repaired.<Close><Close><End of Block>
