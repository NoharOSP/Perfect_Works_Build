So this is the Church

"Yes it is. The Church
workshops are the only
places that officially<New>
repair Gears. Let us ask
about the component we need
to fix <Weltall>.<New>
Time is money, as the old
saying goes!
Let us do what we need to
do as quickly as possible."<Close><End of Block>

"Sorry to bother you.<New>
Our Gear has broken down,
so I would like to buy a
part to fix it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Yes, we are hoping to
replace the bypass circuit
of an X-29-model injector."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:28 h:4>

"I see.
Sorry for the
trouble."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:52 h:4>
These days the Church's
technology has become
indispensable in people's
day-to-day lives.<New>
We thought we'd use these
leftover facilites and
try to help everyone as
much as we can.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:58 h:3>
Hey, it's you guys.<New>
As you can see, this facility
is for the repair of worker
Gears only.<New>
We simply can't help you out
with the new-model military
Gear that you have.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:60 h:4>
This town was orginally a
haven for treasure hunters
searching the ruins.<New>
Our workshop can hardly keep
up with the demand for repairs
on the worker Gears used in
the excavation of the ruins.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:40 h:2>
Hmm?
How can we help you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:40 h:4>
I see <--> causing you
some trouble, huh?
Can you tell me the
part's model number?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:50 h:4>
X-29-model injector?<New>
That's only used by the
latest military models.
We don't keep those kinds
of parts in stock here.<New>
You can only get such
special parts by placing
an order with the Church
headquarters of Ignis.<New>
This workshop is only
for the repair of
civilian Gears...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:30 h:2>
Sorry that we
can't help you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:44 h:2>
Please don't touch it.
It's being repaired.<Close><Close><End of Block>
