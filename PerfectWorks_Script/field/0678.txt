Kislev Army, so we can
most likely recover the
part from Kislev Gears."<Close><End of Block>

Hey, are you letting
him go out there alone?<New>
Lots of fights break out
in the desert... It's a
real dangerous place.<New>
I've heard about a group
of pirates riding around
attacking people on a
sand cruiser.<New>
You really shouldn't let
him go out there by
himself.<Close><End of Block>

Sorry, it's not back yet.
Please wait a bit longer.<Close><End of Block>

Could you wait a while?<New>
The one I rented out to
