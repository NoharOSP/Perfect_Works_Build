He is the second advent
of Lacan<--> No, of Grahf,
the man in black!<New>
We must imprison
him immediately,<New>

what kind of situation
he'll bring about!<Close><End of Block>

Zephyr
"Cease this at once!<New>
Can we not at least
wait for Wiseman to
return before we make
a decision?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:52 h:4>
A tactician he may be, but
why so concerned with him?<New>
I remained silent when I
heard that he had been
appointed after the late
Khan at your insistence,<New>
but why choose someone
we know basically nothing
about?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:34 h:2>
Zephyr
"Well, that is<-->"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:54 h:3>
We must face up to reality!
To the existence of that

What's all this
about a second
advent of Grahf?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:52 h:4>
The Day of Collapse was
Grahf's doing.<New>
It was Grahf who commanded
the Diabolos and had them
destroy this world.<New>
And Id's power is all
too similar to Grahf's.
We cannot allow such a
threat to roam free.<New>
We must freeze him in
carbonite immediately.
Otherwise, he could<--><Close><End of Block>

"No...!<Delay 10>
At the moment, Fei
is Fei, right?<New>
If that's the case,
then<-->"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:48 h:3>
But he is far
too dangerous!<New>
Think about it <-->
he destroyed the Solaris
Capital single-handedly!<New>
We cannot let him
remain at large!<Close><End of Block>

Jessie
"Not only that.<New>
In the past, countless
cities have been crushed
by this Id.<New>
Though I don't know
their intentions,
Grahf and Karellen were
always involved.<New>
Once such place is Elul.
Homeland of Dominia from
the Elements.<New>
The purge of Elul,
which had rebelled
against Solaris, was
carried out by Id.<New>
To determine his
abilities.<New>
In the end, it wasn't
just Elul <--><New>
the Solaris unit that
happened to be present
was completely wiped
out too..."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"He attacked the Ygg...<Delay 10>
attacked us..."<Close><End of Block>

I knew it was him..."<Close><End of Block>

The risks are too great."<Close><End of Block>

No...
It's too cruel!"<Close><End of Block>

It is decided.<Delay 10>
In which case, he

<TextBlock 18 w:62 h:4>
That which the Gazel Ministry
of Solaris desperately seeks...
is the twelve Anima Vessels
created by God's wisdom.<New>
The merging of an Anima Vessel
and a Gear can produce an 
Omnigear...<New>
But the subjects must be in
suitable synchronization or
else the transformation will
not occur.<New>
Some of the Anima Vessels have
been discovered, but there are
still more left undiscovered,
sleeping deep in the earth.<New>
Even we have been devoting
much to the search...
but, to no avail...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:58 h:4>
The power of the Omnigears
was so great that they could
even stave off the Diabolos
Collapse 500 years ago.<New>
If any more of these fall
into the hands of the
enemy...<New>
Our future and even those
of the land dwellers will
be<-->!!<New>
I implore you, land dwellers!
We require your assistance.<New>
Shevat must collect the
remaining Anima Vessels,
by any means necessary...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:3>
Hmhmm...<Delay 20>
So the Anima Vessels were
created by God's wisdom.<New>
I wonder if that is
truly the case...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:50 h:3>
If anything, those units
are for merging with
something inorganic.<New>
That would be the proper
assumption...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:46 h:3>
It is foolish of humans
chu try chu depend on
such things...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:50 h:2>
Oh, I'm just mumbling to
myself.<Delay 20> Pay me no heed.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:48 h:3>
Hmmm...Vessel, Vessel...
Where did you go chu,
little Anima Vessel?<Close><Close><End of Block>
