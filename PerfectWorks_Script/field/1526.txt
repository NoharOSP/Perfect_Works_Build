That is Lacan...
No, the dark one.
Grahf's second advent!<New>
We must restrain and seal
him up otherwise we don't
know what may occur!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:50 h:3>
Zephyr
"Cease this at once!<New>
May we at least wait for
Wiseman to return before
we make any resolutions?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:54 h:4>
Although a tactician, why
do you place so much
importance on him?<New>
I have been silent all this
time since Khan's death,
since he was directly
recruited by the Queen.<New>
However, I question why you
would use such a person
whose principles lack any
understanding of sacrifice?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:36 h:2>
Zephyr
"Well, that is..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:50 h:3>
You must look at reality!
The existence of that
power!<Close><End of Block>

"Hold on, hold on.
What's this Grahf's
second advent?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
The Day of the Collapse
was brought upon by Grahf.
Grahf manipulated Diabolos
into destroying this world.<New>
And that power within Id is
far too similar to Grahf's.
We cannot allow such a
hazard to be set free.<New>
We ought to immediately
freeze him in carbonite.
Otherwise, expect the
worst at any moment...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:42 h:4>
Elly
"No...!
But isn't the present
Fei the real Fei?<New>
If that's the case,
then why..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:3>
But he is still far too
dangerous! Think about it.<New>
He single-handedly
annihilated the Solaris
capital!<New>
We can't set him free!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:54 h:4>
Jessie
"Not only that.<New>
In the past, there were
countless other cities
that were destroyed by Id.<New>
I don't know their
intentions, but Grahf
and Karellen were always
involved somehow.<New>
And one of those incidents
was Elul.<New>
It was Dominia's homeland.<New>
Solaris' purging of the
rebelling city of Elul was
done through the use of Id.
To test his capabilities.<New>
As a result, not only was
Elul taken down, all the
Solaris units present
were wiped out..."<Close><End of Block>

"He's responsible for
the Ygg's...and our..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:44 h:4>
Rico
"So he was the one who
killed my subordinates
in the sewers..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"What's wrong with you all?
Aren't we supposed to be
his friends!?"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"It appears everyone else
is in agreement... The
risks are far too great."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:36 h:4>

"Citan!?
No...
That is terrible!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:12 h:2>
Zephyr
"..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:52 h:3>
It's decided then.
He will be scheduled for
carbon freezing, tomorrow.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:62 h:4>
That which the Gazel Ministry
of Solaris desperately seeks...
is the twelve Anima Vessels
created by God's wisdom.<New>
The merging of an Anima Vessel
and a Gear can produce an 
Omnigear...<New>
But the subjects must be in
suitable synchronization or
else the transformation will
not occur.<New>
Some of the Anima Vessels have
been discovered, but there are
still more left undiscovered,
sleeping deep in the earth.<New>
Even we have been devoting
much to the search...
but, to no avail...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:58 h:4>
The power of the Omnigears
was so great that they could
even hold back the Diabolos
Collapse 500 years ago.<New>
If any more of these fall
into the hands of the
enemy...<New>
Our future and even those
of the land dwellers will
be<-->!!<New>
I implore you, land dwellers!
We require your assistance.<New>
Shevat must collect the
remaining Anima Vessels,
by any means necessary...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:48 h:3>
Hmhmm...<Delay 20>
So the Anima Vessels were
created by God's wisdom.<New>
I wonder if that is
truly the case...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:50 h:3>
If anything, those units
are for merging with
something inorganic.<New>
That would be the proper
assumption...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:46 h:3>
It is foolish of humans
chu try chu depend on
such things...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:50 h:2>
Oh, I'm just mumbling to
myself.<Delay 20> Pay me no heed.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:48 h:3>
Hmmm...Vessel, Vessel...
Where did you go chu,
little Anima Vessel?<Close><Close><End of Block>
