go on believing that.<New>

this if you don't want
to, you know.<New>
Your opponent is the
person you love...
If you decide to quit now,
no one will blame you."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"To quit would be
meaningless.<New>
All that I have fought for,
and all that I live for,
would come to have no
meaning at all...<New>
People should be free. With
no one bound by others, and
no one binding others...<New>
Inside of me, there is a
part of me that desires
that freedom, and a part
of me that gives me hope.<New>
So, I shall fight to
win true freedom!
For we are still alive!<New>
We fight to live.
That is the reason
why I fight.
It's proof I'm human.<New>
I promised my father, and
myself too, that I would
free Elly from Deus' binds,
that I would save her..."<Close><End of Block>

Softly covering up

Our sorrow, our defilement,

About Elly...<Delay 20>
What if, even if we break

she doesn't
return to normal..."<Close><Close><End of Block>
