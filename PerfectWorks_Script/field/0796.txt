Oh, Margie...<New>
We're so glad you're safe...<Close><End of Block>

to Bart and his men."<Close><End of Block>

We just received word...<New>
so we were singing a

We're so happy...
Oh, what a relief!<Close><End of Block>

Sister Agnes
"Welcome back, Margie.<New>
We had faith that you and
your cousin Bart would one

We and your other friends

I heard about it at

I'll never go anywhere

I won't make you all worry

<TextBlock 13 w:48 h:3>

isn't like you at all!<New>
Here I am, back
safe and sound.<New>
Can't you tell me
off just a little,
for old time's sake?"<Close><End of Block>

I'm sorry...<New>
But I'm just so

May I go upstairs?<New>
It's been oh so long,
so I want to have a look
around up there, too."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:54 h:2>

Don't even think of holding
back from anything...<New>
Except for one thing...<New>
Never stay away so long
like that again."<Close><End of Block>

Something wrong, Margie?"<Close><End of Block>

It's just..."<Close><End of Block>

You've been through

I'll show Fei and Citan
around our cathedral...<Delay 10>
Follow me!"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"What a strong
girl she is...<New>
It is obvious that she
really wants to just
break down and cry..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:48 h:3>
Bart
"Yeah, you're right...<New>
That's just the way
she has always been.<New>
For all her talk, she
understands her position
well...<New>
Maybe there are a few
things I could learn
from her, too."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:42 h:2>

"...How magnificent!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:50 h:4>
Margie
"If we ever got scolded
for pranks as kids, Bart
and I used to hide here."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:38 h:4>
Bart
"Hey, stop telling
those old stories.
It's embarrassing!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:50 h:3>
Margie
"But to me, Bart hasn't
changed much since then."<Close><End of Block>

You mean that you think
I'm still a kid!?"<Close><End of Block>

here the best."<Close><End of Block>

through the stained glass
of the cathedral's front...<New>
What a brilliant piece of
artistry this is."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:48 h:4>
Margie
"Did you notice that the
two great angels only
have one wing each...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:54 h:3>
   According to a legend
  handed down in Nisan...<New>
  God could have created
    humans perfectly...<New>
 But then humans would not
 have helped each other...<New>
So that is what these great
   single-winged angels
       symbolize...<New>
 In order to fly, they are
 dependent on one another.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"Ah, so that is the
reason for it.<New>
I see...<Delay 5>
On further inspection,
the left angel looks
somewhat masculine...<New>
...while the right one
looks somewhat feminine."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:46 h:3>
Citan
"Now that is an unusual
feature, is it not?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:52 h:3>
Citan
"Usually these depictions
are not gender-specific.<New>
But these angels are
clearly distinguishable as
having opposing genders."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:44 h:4>
Citan
"And the space between
them is the path from
where God advents..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:42 h:3>
Citan
"Or could it be the
path leading TO God?<New>
Well...I do not know.
It could be either,
or even both."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:30 h:2>
Citan
"...Now I see!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:46 h:3>
Citan
"This all reflects the
teachings of Nisan."<Close><End of Block>

"Ha, ha, ha!
Why, Citan, you're an
interesting fellow!"<Close><End of Block>

Excuse me.<New>
My usual habit, there..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"The doc knows a lot
about a lot of things...<New>
Sometimes I don't
understand what he's
talking about, either."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:46 h:4>
Bart
"...Hah!
Forcing them to fly
together...?<New>
It would be less
bothersome if they
could fly on their own,
don't you think, Fei?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:54 h:4>
Margie
"Bart!
You miss the deeper meaning
and beauty of it!"<Close><End of Block>

Margie
"Someday I wish I could
be of help to someone
like that..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:52 h:4>
Margie
"Oh, we didn't go to the
Room of Lady Sophia yet,
did we?<New>
You're really supposed to
go through some checks
before you can see it...<New>
But this time I think it
will be alright if I make
a special exception."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:28 h:2>
Fei
"Lady Sophia?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 57 w:44 h:4>
Margie
"Yes, Lady Sophia.<New>
She is revered as the
founding Mother of the
Nisan nation...<New>
and the founder of the
Nisan religion who set
forth its teachings.<New>
There is a special
room upstairs that
has a portrait of
Lady Sophia in it."<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"I would definitely like
to view that! Fei, let us
go have a look at it!<Close><End of Block>

on the second floor from
here..."<Close><End of Block>

No unauthorized persons

<TextBlock 66 w:34 h:3>
Hey, hey!
Don't go up there
like that!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 67 w:54 h:3>
I moved from another
town to live here...<New>
But they say some young
people do the opposite
and move away from here.<New>
I wonder if it is because
they want something more
than peace in their hearts?<New>
I guess that is just how
young people are today!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 68 w:58 h:3>
My husband was a soldier in
the Royal Capital's army...<New>
But he died a few years back,
near the border of Kislev.<New>
Since then, I have been
coming here every year on
the anniversary of his death.<Close><End of Block>

I live in the Royal Capital,<Delay 30>

Ah... Maybe...
<Delay 30>I think."<Close><End of Block>

Are you putting

I'm on a pilgrimage all
over this country, and
recently traveled to the
Royal Capital area.<New>
I just got back here a
few days ago, but will
probably be leaving here
again in a few days time.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 83 w:46 h:3>
I want to see with my
own eyes what will
become of this country.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 84 w:64 h:5>
Preparations should be starting
near the border of this sect's
country for the charge by
the Royal Capital's army.<New>
But a miscalculated move
directed on the enemy is
certain to backfire
on us, so we'll be taking covert
action for a while.<New>
I'm on my way there now, but I
thought I'd offer a prayer
before I go.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 85 w:54 h:4>
As a matter of fact, the
guy next to me and I were
born here.<New>
Years ago, we both got
tired of the peaceful but
boring life here, so we
ran away from home.<New>
But we both ended up
enlisting in the army.<New>
It's not that we have any
particularly happy memories
or whatever here...<New>
it's just that, after all,
this is the land of our
birth, so well y'know...<Close><Close><End of Block>
