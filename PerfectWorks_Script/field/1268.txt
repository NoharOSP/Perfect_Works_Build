"Long, long ago there was
a woman named Zephyr. <New>
She wanted to be a god
so she built a tower that
reached up to heaven.<New>
Then she built a city at
the top. But god got mad
and destroyed her tower.<New>
So she then had to live
in a 'hideout for sinful
hermits'.<New>
After that she never 
returned to the earth
again... The end."<Close><End of Block>
