Citan
"Striking directly at the
center rather than using
fuel unnecessarily...<New>
That is one strategy. But,
I believe another plan of
attack would be to defeat
its surroundings first.<New>
If we decide to attack
the supporting orbs first,
then it might be wise to
leave the battles up to us.<New>
We should be able to do
something about them
without using up Fei's
power."<Close><End of Block>

the core."<Close><End of Block>

strike to the core or take
down the supports first...<New>
I guess that is best left
up to Fei to decide..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:46 h:4>
Rico
"So that means that big
thing in the middle is
the core of Deus?"<Close><End of Block>

That is probably the

There is only a slight
energy response coming

"What about Elly?
What's happening to her
inside of that thing?<New>
The Deus system's bind

off now. <New>
So why aren't we getting
any kind of response!?<Delay 10>
You don't think we hurt her
in that battle too...!?"<Close><End of Block>

The sensors are picking

It is probably Elly.<Delay 20>
So do not worry...<Delay 10>
I believe she is okay!"<Close><End of Block>

What's wrong?"<Close><End of Block>

tremendous amount of energy
coming from within Deus.<New>
It seems as if something

has suddenly been freed and
is growing enormously..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"That's gotta be it.<New>
The 'Wave Existence' was
just freed from its 'cage
of fleshly existence' in
Zohar...<New>
It's probably attempting
to return to the higher
dimension that it
originally came from."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:44 h:4>

the aftereffect of the

'aftereffect'!?"<Close><End of Block>

Can't we stop the

is nothing we can do...<New>
Almost all machinery,

This time, there is nothing

Without Zohar, the power

I am going to go save
Elly!"<Close><End of Block>
