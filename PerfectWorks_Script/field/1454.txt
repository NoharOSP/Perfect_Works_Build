"Uh...it doesn't move.<Delay 20>
Is it broken...?<New>

There's something small
written here...<New>
'The one who attains the
dawn, the dusk, and the
darkness shall climb the
path to heaven...<New>

Let the <Chu-Chu> in a

Set those three stones we

Oh, we rarely have
visitors from the surface.<New>
Welcome to the wandering 
city in the sky, Aphel 
Aura.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:56 h:5>
This city used to be the
capital of Shevat, an
independent liberal country 
that fought against Solaris.<New>
A place that turns
yesterday's tears into
tomorrow's smiles...<Delay 20>
That's what they called
this city a long time ago...<New>
But now, those hopes and
despairs have long since
been worn away...<New>
Probably the only things
that remain are the echoes
of resentment...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:52 h:3>
You might be able to find
something that can solve
your troubles and sadness.<New>
But fate can be cruel
sometimes...<Delay 20>
Don't forget that.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:48 h:4>
Also, that stone plate
floating there is called
a 'stepping stone'.<Delay 20> It
moves with people on it.<New>
Try getting on it and
talking to the stone.<Delay 20>
It'll be glad to give
three of you a ride.<Close><End of Block>

Oh, are you new?<Delay 20>
It's been so long since
last time we had a visitor
from the surface.<New>
This is a 'plant shell'.<Delay 20>
Vegetables and fruits
needed in Shevat are grown 
in it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:50 h:4>
Since we live away from
the land, we must put
more effort to get food.<New>
Right now, it's a dusty
season so only the staff
members are allowed to 
go in.<New>
Humans are good carriers 
of germs, you know.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:48 h:4>
I'll bring some fresh
Thunder Strawberries for
you to eat.<Delay 20> So look
forward to it.<Close><End of Block>

you?<Delay 20>
    I want thread!
    Hear a story<Close><End of Block>

<Opcode 1 255>After all, pain only
causes more pain and
sadness...<New>
How come those guys up
there don't understand
such a simple thing...?<New>
Just relax, have fun
fishing like that sage
who disappeared.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:40 h:3>
<Opcode 1 255>Do you like fishing?<Delay 20>
    Yes
    Not really...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:50 h:4>
<Opcode 1 255>I see. Then, do you want
to try catching some fish
in the plaza?<Delay 20> Fishing is
prohibited there though.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:52 h:4>
<Opcode 1 255>I see...<Delay 20>
The sage loved fishing.
He used to go to the plaza
and catch Leviathans.<New>
After catching the fish,
he'd feed it some small
black stone and let it
go... <New>
I wonder if that was 
just fish food.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:48 h:4>
<Opcode 1 255>I have some good thread.
Want it for 50G?<Delay 20>
    I'll buy it!!
    No thanks...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:52 h:4>
<Opcode 1 255>Hey, you already have some
good spider thread.<New>
Try hanging the line in
the center of the plaza.<Delay 20>
You'll catch a fish if
you're good.<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 25 w:38 h:2>
<Opcode 1 255>Are you sure?
It's good thread...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:54 h:4>
This city has been
wandering the sky like
this for 500 years...<New>
Just watching the 
ever-changing countries, 
the world, and those who
appeared and disappeared...<New>
The people in Shevat lost
power, so that's all they
could do...<New>
Being able to observe may
have been a reward for
those people here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:48 h:4>
The people in this city
had dreamed of going
down to the land again
for a long time...<New>
They dreamed of the day
when they could go down
to the free world after
fleeing from Solaris...<New>
I have a hunch the day
may not be <Delay 20>too far away.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:48 h:4>
Why do humans hate and
hurt each other?<Delay 20>
Everyone lives under
the same blue sky...<New>
Will there ever be any
relief from the pain of
losing what was precious
to us?<New>
When will the day come
when we can understand
what all this loneliness
and sorrow was for?<New>
In the end, we may be
repeating the same
mistake we made
500 years ago...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:46 h:4>
This is the end of the
city.<Delay 20> If you're not
leaving yet, you better
turn back.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:44 h:4>
Oh, so you're waiting
to meet up with Maria?<Delay 10>
    Yes, that's right!
    No, we're not<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:54 h:3>
If that's the case, then...
down there is a house that
no one lives in anymore.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:56 h:4>
Maria often used to go there
and sit all alone in the
second floor of that house
and think about things.<New>
Why don't you check out the
place and see what you can
find while you wait for her
there...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:50 h:4>
Oh? So you're not?<Delay 10> Sorry.<Delay 20>
Well anyway, why not rest
up and unwind in our fair
city...?<Close><Close><End of Block>
