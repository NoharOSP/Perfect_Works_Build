First of all, that
partition we took to get

leave a facility like
that unlocked and open?"<Close><End of Block>

You were able to get into

"Originally this was

The Emperor, who reigns

Creatures called humans

Emperor Cain and the 
elders comprising the 
Gazel Ministry.<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Naturally, that was 
only one person, the 
Emperor. He is a human 
whose destiny is to 
never die.<New>
But the Gazel's destiny 
was different.<New>
Due to the war with 
the former 
surface-dwellers... 
or, rather, because of 
the Diabolos' invasion,<Delay 30>
the old men of Gazel lost 
their bodies altogether.<New>
Now the Solaris-governing 
Gazel Ministry exists 
on memory banks,<New>

personalities mere data."<Close><End of Block>

"After the Day of Collapse,
they became fixated upon
their corporeality.<New>
Desiring resurrection,
they transferred one of
the Soylent Systems from
the surface to Etemenanki<New>
so that it might produce
suitable bodies.<New>
Eventually the institution,
no longer limited to
researching only the
Emperor's longevity<New>
treatments and Ministry's
corporeal resurrection,
came to double as a
facility researching<New>
organic weapons, along with
special food and drug
additives that would
regulate public opinion.<New>
The memory cubes, too,
which Fei and the others
used without concern...<New>
They are devices that were
installed to collect
surface-dwellers' bio-data.<New>
Of course, various data was
also sent by the Church
of the Ethos to help."<Close><End of Block>
