Ever since my oldest son
was drafted, I've been
so lonely.<New>
My younger son is up on
the roof looking north.<Delay 10>

comes home safely...<New>
He's such a gentle child,

make it in the army.<New>
He used to arrange the
flowers upstairs.
But now I do it as
I pray for his safety.<Close><End of Block>

My oldest son came back!<New>
My prayers were answered.
Now I'm putting all my
effort into cooking.<Close><Close><End of Block>
