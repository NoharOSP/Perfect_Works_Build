control ship...<New>
The other seven are
all Ether guided.<New>
Just who the hell is
controlling them all?"<Close><End of Block>

I never thought you'd
be the escort commander.<Close><End of Block>

Hey, not the one from
the Elements...?"<Close><End of Block>

"Hmph.<New>
It's been a long time,
Elehayym. The last time
was Jugend, wasn't it?"<Close><End of Block>

"What are you
doing here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:4>
Dominia
"This is a vital mission,
ordered from Central.<New>
I already have Ramsus'
orders. The Hecht is not
to be piloted by a
common soldier.<New>
I will take the Hecht."<Close><End of Block>

"An escort is hardly
necessary, but also
part of the plan.<New>
This will be a
good fight."<Close><End of Block>

"Wait! Tell me what our
target is!
Surely you know."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:52 h:3>
Dominia
"That's restricted...<Delay 30>
but I guess I can tell.<New>
The power plant in the
eastern sector of Kislev's
Imperial Capital.<New>
The target is a reactor
left there by an ancient
civilization."<Close><End of Block>

"The reactor!?
If you attack that,
then Kislev will<-->"<Close><End of Block>

"Probably most of it
will be destroyed.<New>
The rest will be
uninhabitable
for hundreds of years."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Why are you doing this?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:52 h:4>
Dominia
"To purge. Why else?<New>
You, too, must have
heard... Kislev has a
Gatekeeper.<New>
The whole point of the
Gate is to manage those
vulgar Lambs.<New>
This barrier to the
surface was made by our
greatest pioneers.<New>
The Lambs are trying to
destroy that barrier.
Are you going to allow
that?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:48 h:4>
Elly
"That... That may be
so...<Delay 30>but do we have the
right to get involved?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:48 h:4>
Dominia
"Does that bother you?
Since when did you have
a conscience?<New>
War, strife, betrayal,
and deceit are all that
are on the Lambs' minds.<New>
Surely you should know
that by looking at the
fools in this country.<New>
Just let them loose and
see what they'd do.<New>
They would pillage and
loot our world, acting
as if they owned it.<New>
Common house pets have
no need for advanced
knowledge or tools!<New>
We must lead them to
where they belong."<Close><End of Block>

So why...?"<Close><End of Block>

You regard me as the
same as those stupid
Lambs!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:3>
Dominia
"Yes, well...<New>
You're the one who
shirked your duty and ran
away, back at Jugend,<New>
despite all you had
accomplished.<New>
Arguing with you is a
waste of time."<Close><End of Block>

"I was a surface dweller
myself, but I'm going to
purge the Lambs.<New>
I want you, the Abelites,
to see with your own eyes
what I can do."<Close><Close><End of Block>
