Hello, surface people.
Look at this picture.<Delay 20>
It's me and my wife a
long time ago.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:54 h:4>
It may be hard to believe
but there was a time when
we were young too,<Delay 20>
full of dreams and hopes.<New>
My wife died two years ago.<Delay 20>
So, I asked the people in
the world below to bury
her ashes in the earth.<New>
My time will also come
soon...<Delay 20> Could you young
people bury my ashes in
the earth for me too...?<New>
I'm tired of...waiting...
and believing...<Delay 20>
I want to rest in peace
in the earth.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:48 h:4>
But I was wondering what
it would be like to live
without getting old,
like Queen Zephyr...<New>
What has she seen
and heard these past
500 years?<New>
Did what she see and
hear really bring her
happiness...?<Delay 20>
That, I don't know.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:56 h:4>
This country's been
through a lot.<Delay 20>
We no longer have enough
strength to fight Solaris...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:3>
You people from the
world below should go
to the royal palace.<New>
Queen Zephyr will listen
to your wishes and show
you the way.<New>
You may be the new hope
for those who're against
Solaris...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:46 h:3>
