is merely a convenience
for my activities on Earth.<New>
The 'Church of the Ethos' 
was created as a Solaris 
sub-organization<New> 
and given the task of 
managing earth-dwellers.<New>
But over the years the
'Church of the Ethos' 
started to set up<New> 
convenient doctrines for 
itself...<New>
It then went on to gather
the ignorant masses, and
created a god for them to
believe in.<New>
Then, the 'Church of the 
Ethos' even went so far as 
to plot a separation from 
its creator, Solaris.<New>
So Solaris had no choice
but to eliminate all those
who defy our rule and raise
the flag of rebellion.<New>
The ones prepared as
'eliminators' were<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
the Etone.<New>
Etones, 'the Atoners',<Delay 5><New> 
the organization I 
established within the 
'Church of the Ethos',<Delay 5> 
had two purposes<Delay 5>...<New>
On the surface their aim
was to eliminate the<Delay 5>
'Reapers'<Delay 5> or <Delay 5>-Wels-<Delay 5> that
run rampant on the earth.<New>
But,<Delay 10> that's not their only
purpose.<Delay 20> Behind the scenes,
we also had selected men
like Verlaine<Delay 5>...<New>
These were responsible for
observing<Delay 10> and eliminating<Delay 10>
any corrupt people<New> 
who appeared in the 
'Church of the Ethos'.<New>
You didn't have the chance
to learn of this, since you
left the 'Church of the 
Ethos' so early.<New>

I just never told you.<Delay 20>

In fact, the <Delay 5>'God'<Delay 5> and

And that's not all.<New>
Saving orphans and

that may seem like
works of mercy.<New>
But the little boys and

Indulging in selfish
desires...<Delay 20>
This is not 'conduct
befitting priests'!<New>
Such defiled leaven have
no right to speak for god.
That is why we set out on

"God?<Delay 20>
Where does such
a being exist?<New>
You should know by now how
the 'Church of the Ethos' 
came about...<New>
It was an organization
created by Solaris aeons
ago solely for the purpose
of managing ignorant humans.<New>
Its doctrines are just
deceptions designed to
control the masses.<New>
The 'Church of the Ethos' 
used the two sweet fruits of 
'faith' and 'technology' well 
to skillfully manipulate global
affairs and people's zeal.<New>
Thus, they manipulated the
ignorant masses to
repeatedly continue their
pointless wars.<New>
Eventually, battle data on
'man' and 'weapons' gleaned
from these wars, were sent
to Solaris itself...<New>
And analyzed to aid in 
ruling the entire Earth.<New>
These intentionally
perpetuated wars caused
much psychological discord.<New>
But faith in 'god'...<Delay 20>
salvation...
was used as a cushion
to soften the blow.<New>
It was a well thought-
out system.<Delay 20>
But the choice of managers
was extremely poor.<New>
Or did you think that acting
the part of a faithful
servant of god would
someday yield an answer
from a great god somewhere?<New>
Can't you see that such
a divine being just 'never
existed from the beginning'?<New>
And you don't seem to
realize this, but you
yourself were 'passing
judgement on sinners'
as much as we were!"<Close><End of Block>
