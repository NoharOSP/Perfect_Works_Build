"The status of bishop
is merely a convenience
for my activities here.<New>
The Church was created as
a Solaris sub-organization
and given the task of
managing land dwellers.<New>
But over the years the
Church started to set
up convenient doctrines
for itself...<New>
It then went on to bring
together the ignorant
masses, and created a god
for them to believe in.<New>
Then, the Church even
went so far as to plot
a separation from its
creator, Solaris.<New>
So Solaris had no choice
but to eliminate all those
who defied our rule and lit
the fire of rebellion.<New>
The ones prepared as the
'eliminators' were<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
the Etones.<New>
'The atoners of sin',<Delay 5> the
organization I established
within the Church.<New>
Ostensibly, their aim was
to eliminate the Verus,<Delay 5>
the revenants that run
rampant on the surface.<New>
But<Delay 10> that was not their
primary objective.<New>
Behind the scenes, we had
also selected suitable
candidates like Verlaine
and the others...<New>
They were responsible for
observing<Delay 10> and eliminating<Delay 10>
any corrupt people who
appeared within the Church.<New>
For you who moved on from
the Church early to found
your orphanage, there was
no chance to learn of this.<New>
<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>Or rather,<Delay 5>
I just never told you.<Delay 20>
There was 'another role'
I wanted you to perform!"<Close><End of Block>

of the system, its true
form.<Delay 10> Indeed, was the
system of<Delay 5> 'God'<Delay 5> and <Delay 5>'faith'<New>

I feel the urge to slice

your innards...<New>
But I can't actually

"The pontiff and his
brethren deserve to die!<New>
The desire to renounce their
'duties of the Church' as
assigned by Solaris, and
pursue world domination...<New>
They sentenced themselves
to death the moment such a
desire took hold of them.<New>
And that's not all.<New>
Saving orphans and
refugees<Delay 5>...<Delay 5> That may
seem like charity.<New>
But in truth the little boys
and girls kept here were
used as a means to satisfy
the desires of the pontiff
and bishops.<New>
Indulging in selfish
desires...<Delay 20> This is conduct
'unbecoming of churchmen'!<New>
Such corrupt wretches are not
fit to be representatives
of God. That is why we have
purged them and made them
atone for their sins.<New>
These are the bishop's
orders!"<Close><End of Block>

Verlaine
"God?<Delay 20>
Where would you say
this 'God' is?<New>
Don't you know by now?
How the Church of the
Ethos came about?<New>
It was an organization
created by Solaris in the
distant past, solely for the
purpose of managing ignorant
surface dwellers.<New>
Its doctrines are
fabrications, made for
controlling the masses.<New>
The Church used the two
sweet fruits of 'faith'
and 'technology' well,<New>
skillfully manipulating
surface world affairs
and the people's zeal.<New>
Thus, the manipulated
populace just repeated
their wars endlessly.<New>
Eventually, battle data
on 'humans' and 'weapons'
gleaned from these wars
was sent to the Solaris
homeland...<New>
...and analyzed to aid in 
ruling the entire Earth.<New>
These intentionally
perpetuated wars gave
rise to all kinds of
psychological problems.<New>
But faith in God <--><Delay 20>
salvation <--> was used as a
cushion to soften the blow.<New>
It was a well-thought-out
system.<Delay 20> But the choice of
managers was extremely poor.<New>
Did you think that if you
played the devout servant
you would surely be
answered by an almighty
'God' someday?<New>
Can't you see that such
a divine being simply 'never
existed to begin with'?<New>
What's more, though you
don't seem to realize it,
is that you yourself were
'judging the sinners' as
much as we were!"<Close><End of Block>
