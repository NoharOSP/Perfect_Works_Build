Let's see...<Delay 20>
How about the

<TextBlock 35 w:50 h:7>
For the past several
decades, our scientists
had put great effort
into researching the
creation of more
advanced Gears.<New>
Regardless of how good
the pilot is, as long
as they are human there
will always be time lag
and human error when
interfacing with a
machine.<New>
That's when your father,
Nikola was targeted.<Delay 20>
He was a genius in the
field of cranial nerve
mechanics.<New>
They made Nikola search
for a way for humans to
go beyond humans...<Delay 20>
by merging humans and
machines.<New>
In other words, they were
trying to create a new
life, an ultimate living
weapon,<Delay 10> by connecting a
living human brain to a
Gear directly.<New>
It would've stayed a
mere fantasy<Delay 10> without
Nikola.<Delay 20> But that genius
made the fantasy come
true...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:52 h:7>
As a matter of fact,
various data and
components obtained from
the war in Ignas, and the
Battling in Kislev, were
used as experimental
materials.<New>
That is how the special
humanoid mutants, Wels,
were born.<Delay 20> Wels created
in Solaris were tested
on the surface.<New>
Only the Wels that passed
the tests were dissected,
restructured, and reborn.<Delay 20>
They became the central
control circuits of
Gears...<Delay 10>
Mechanical parts...<New>
It's all the result of
your father's great
research.<Delay 20>
<Seibzehn> is the
prototype of a
man-machine fusion Gear.<New>
In other words...
<Seibzehn> was completed
at the cost of innumerable
land dwellers' lives.<Close><End of Block>

You should be well aware

"It looks like our

going on...<New>
Having taken my mother and
I hostage, they had forced
my reluctant father to
continue the research..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:48 h:4>
Maria
"But he never showed his
pain or sorrow in front

he'd say...<New>

<Seibzehn> will be
by your side to
protect you...'"<Close><End of Block>

They're getting

I'll also take a look at

Maria and you're with us,
we have the power of 1000

together, we can teach
Solaris a thing or two!<Close><End of Block>

ending his life like
that...<Close><End of Block>

But this is such a
