"That fight with the
Rankar was remarkable.<New>
An ordinary Gear could
not defeat that monster.
And you certainly keep
yourself in good shape..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:36 h:3>
Fei
"Why did you bring
this here, doc?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:36 h:3>
Citan
"This...?
You mean <Weltall>?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"...<Weltall>?<Delay 20>
This is the Gear that
destroyed Lahan.<New>
Why did you 
bring it here?
I never want to see
another Gear again..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:38 h:4>
Citan
"I understand how
you must feel...<New>
But, in order to
protect yourself
you need a certain
degree of strength.<New>
Even more since we
are being pursued."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Fei
"I agree that some 
strength is needed 
for self-defense.<New>
And if it weren't for this
Gear here, Elly and I'd be
in that Rankar's stomach
right now...<New>
But its power goes beyond
what is necessary. Does
one really need the power
to destroy everything?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:10 h:2>
Citan
"..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:38 h:4>
Fei
"I don't need that
kind of power...
I just hate Gears."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Fei, using power or being
used by power...is that not
a problem of the heart...?<New>
If humans do not use their
power for wrong it can be
a good thing...I believe
such power can help us.<New>
In that respect, I know
you will be fine.
It sure helped you out
this time.<New>
Am I right?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:48 h:4>
Fei
"I want to believe that.
But something is holding
me back. This Gear..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:36 h:4>

"Well, whatever...
At least Elly is
safe now."<Close><End of Block>

have come to."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 16 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"I am Citan...
a friend of Fei's.<New>
You were nearly that 
Rankar's meal!<New>
If Fei had not have helped
you, I hate to think what
may have happened.<New>
But I was not too pleased
with his rashness in trying
to take on that beast
with just his bare fists."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:26 h:2>
Elly
"Bare fists?"<Close><End of Block>

This makes twice."<Close><End of Block>

I'll just put it
on your tab."<Close><End of Block>

"It is getting dark.
Let us set up camp and
start out early tomorrow.<New>
The both of you look tired

Are you alright?"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Oh, so you were awake?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:52 h:4>

I only heard part of what
you two were discussing."<Close><End of Block>

so that's what she is?"<Close><End of Block>

"Fei, she is..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:52 h:3>
Fei
"I know. 
It's not Elly's fault.<New>
What happened to the
village is all my fault.<New>
I took out all my pent up
feelings on Elly. I'm the
one who should apologize."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Fei, do not blame 
yourself. It was not 
your fault either.<New>
You were just trying to
protect the village."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Thanks, doc...
By the way, how is everyone
from the village doing?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:50 h:3>
Citan
"Do not worry, Yui is
taking care of them.<New>
I told her to leave soon
and take them all to... 
a certain place.<New>
They should be safe for a
while. So you just worry
about yourself for now."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:24 h:2>
Fei
"Okay, doc."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Now to think what we
should do next...<New>
Shall we leave this forest
and head for the desert
town of Dazil?<New>
We may learn what Av and
Kislev are up to...
not to mention getting some
parts for <Weltall>.<New>
The leader of Av is not
going to sit back and let
the other night's fiasco
go by unpunished!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:36 h:2>
Fei
"What is that...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"I would assume it is
an aerial battleship
from Av..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"An aerial battleship?
I've never heard of Av
having anything like that."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:44 h:4>
Citan
"Of course it does
not come from Av
originally...<New>
Most likely it belongs
to the Geburah forces
stationed in Av."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:20 h:2>
Fei
"Geburah?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"Special forces from the
Sacred Empire of Solaris
known as Geburah.<New>
I am sure you have heard
something about them.<New>
They are an organization
providing large scale
military aide to the
Kingdom of Av.<New>
They showed up in Ignas
several years ago,
11, to be precise.<New>
Until then, Aveh was
being routed by Kislev.<New>
But with Geburah's help
they have managed to
regain half their loses.<New>
They are now expanding
their territory and
gathering resources
buried in the ruins."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:48 h:4>
Fei
"I've heard the village
elders talk about it...<Delay 30>
Is Elly a part of that?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Quite possibly so.
Their group has superior
technology and power.<New>
It is rumored they are
here solely to get the
resources in the ruins.<New>
I am surprised they are
using something as
powerful as that ship...<New>
It must be to supress the
recent border skirmishes."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:42 h:3>
Fei
"So they are fighting
the Kislev Empire?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"Yes. It seems they have
found new ruins on the
northern edge of Av.<New>
Those ruins are under a
five-hundred-year-old
temple.<New>
Three weeks ago Kislev
took over those ruins.
Most likely they are
fighting over that."<Close><Close><End of Block>
