Ether Bullets raise your

Three shots will easily send
your HG to the MAX

level climbs much faster!<New>
You can continue to Dash
even after your HG reaches
the MAX condition, but as

Receptionist
"There are two reasons for
your loss. First, your over-
reliance on the R1 button
to shoot Ether bullets.<New>
Ether Bullets are useful
when your foe is far away,
but using them too much will
cause problems with your own
Gear's heat level!<New>
Second is your overuse of
Dash movement. The use of
either of these when your
Heat Gauge is at MAX will
cause your Gear to overheat!<New>

you will be taking damage,

your HP will fall to zero
