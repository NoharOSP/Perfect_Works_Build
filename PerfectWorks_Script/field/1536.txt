Long ago, humans were with
God in a paradise in the
sky called Machanon. The
place was protected by the
power of God. Humans were
never exposed to the fear
or danger of death.<New>
However, one day, humans
entered God's forbidden
garden and ate a fruit
which bestowed upon them
tremendous intelligence
and power.<New>
God found out about the
incident and the humans
were banished from the
paradise. The prosperous
times were over, and an
era of sorrow and hatred
began...<Close><End of Block>

Humans banished from the
paradise were foolish
enough to revolt against
God.<New>
In order to resist the
power of God, they
created the twelve
Vessels of Anima, and
called themselves gods...<New>
For ten days and ten
nights, the world shed
its blood, and Machanon
was enveloped in flames.<New>
But human strength was no
match for God and the
arrogant humans were
destroyed by God's anger.
Only a few righteous men
were left on the land.<New>
However, God was also
tired and wounded.
He decided to rest in the
deepest depths of the
earth.<New>
God's rest was long.
But eternity is only
a moment to God.<New>
Since then, the righteous
men who didn't revolt
against God had to live
in the harsh nature by
themselves, being in
constant fear of death...<Close><End of Block>

The legend also says the
following:<Delay 20>
when the righteous men's
children are born again,
God will awaken from his
long rest and give them
a helping hand..<New>

God bring to the people?<Delay 20>

a place known to be God's
resting place.<New>
If Solaris attains that
power, no one will be able
to stop them.<Delay 20>

world then...?<Close><Close><End of Block>
