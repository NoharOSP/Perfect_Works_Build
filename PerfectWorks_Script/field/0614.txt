The remote village of Lahan,

This is where it all begins.<Opcode 2 150><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:68 h:12>
Ignas, the largest continent in
the world, sits in the northern
hemisphere.<Delay 30> Here, a war has been
raging between two countries for
hundreds of years.<Delay 30>
In the north of the continent lies
the Kislev Empire; in the south
lies the desert kingdom, Av.<Delay 30>
The war has gone on for so long
that the people have forgotten the
cause and know only the pointless
cycle of hostility and tragedy.<Delay 200><Delay 200><Delay 200><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:70 h:11>
The chronic war obsession was soon
to encounter a devastating change.<Delay 30>
This was due to the 'Church of the
Ethos',<Delay 10> the caretakers of world
culture,<Delay 10> offering to repair tools
and weapons excavated from the
ruins of an ancient civilization.<Delay 30>
Both countries began excavating
these ruins and, to bolster their
military power, had the Church
repair the discovered artifacts.<Delay 200><Delay 220><Delay 220><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:68 h:10>
The various weapons excavated
from the ruins dramatically
changed the form of warfare.<Delay 30>
The outcome of battles between
the two countries was no longer
determined by man-to-man combat,
but by 'Gears' <--><Delay 10> giant humanoid
fighting machines <--><Delay 10> that were
obtained from deep within the
ruins.<Delay 200><Delay 200><Delay 200><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:70 h:11>
Eventually,<Delay 10> after both fronts
continually turned the tides,<Delay 10>
Kislev finally gained the upper
hand,<Delay 30> owing their success to a
greater wealth of resources buried
within their ruins.<Delay 30>
But suddenly, a mysterious military
force appeared on the continent of
Ignas.<Delay 20> Called 'Geburah', this
force decided to make contact
with Av.<Delay 200><Delay 200><Delay 200><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:72 h:11>
With the assistance of this Geburah
military force,<Delay 5> Av was able to
recover from being hopelessly
outnumbered to being back on an
even standing with Kislev.<Delay 30>
Then,<Delay 10> taking further advantage of
its newly gained momentum,<Delay 10> Av
started to annex Kislev territories
one after another<Delay 10> and showed
no indication of slowing down in
their invasion campaign.<Delay 200><Delay 220><Delay 220><Close><End of Block>
