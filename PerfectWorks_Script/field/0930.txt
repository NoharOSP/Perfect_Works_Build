...The number one Gate
generator is 200 kelts
southwest of Noatun and
4000 sharls underground.<New>
Its interference waves make
guided weapon use impossible
in this area. So up to the
last minute the Hecht must
be piloted manually.<New>
After canceling stealth
mode, you will provide
direct escort for the Hecht
inside the enemy defense
zone. Any questions?<Close><End of Block>

"But without knowing our
objective, our response to
any orders will be slow.<New>
Even if we're just ordered
to provide cover.
We need to at least know
the attack objective..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:56 h:4>
The objective will be issued
during the mission.
It will be relayed directly
to the Hecht's pilots.<Close><End of Block>

main briefing.<New>
Confirm terrain, weather

with the information at
hand.<New>
The mission starts at

Until then wait in your
assigned units.<New>
I shouldn't have to
remind you that this
mission is a purge.<New>
Remember, we have
complete authority

How can we go along with
