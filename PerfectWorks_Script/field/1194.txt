This is what we do...
First we transform my Yggdrasil
into heavy assault mode and
load it onto the Excalibur so
we can couple the generators.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:52 h:5>
By doing that, we can
reduce the energy usage
down to just supporting
the hull of the ship and
generating the barrier.<New>
This will allow most of
the energy to be devoted
to generating the barrier.<New>
Next, shift the barrier to
full front and focus it to
a single point where their
main cannon will make its
strike.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:54 h:5>
Now for movement.
First off, we develop
a barrier by engaging
Excalibur's generator
to maximum power.<New>
For propulsion during that
time, we'll install on the
Yggdrasil those large solid
rockets we got from the
ruins of the Mass-driver.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:48 h:4>
When Excalibur's barrier
expires, we'll use the
Yggdrasil IV's generator
to develop a barrier.<New>
Then we'll also detach
the solid rockets and
shift the Excalibur into
conventional flight.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:50 h:4>
Using this method, we can
get right in Merkabah's
face. After it fires,
it'll be defenseless.<New>
During this time, we'll
block the muzzle of
Merkabah's cannon with
Excalibur's bow ram.<New>
Upon which, we should
have 0.67 seconds...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:56 h:6>
With the cannon fire of the
Excalibur, we'll destroy the
Yggdrasil IV's slave
generator and incapacitate
the Merkabah along the way,
and then...we breakthrough!<Close><End of Block>

"...That's what the plan
is all about.<New>
The combination of the
barriers of both ships...
Storming the Merkabah...<New>
The timing of the cannon
fire of the Excalibur...
These are all going to
be crucial.<New>
Mess up any one of these
and the consequences are
going to be severe.<New>
Hence, it'll be necessary
to have both crews in
