"Deus,<Delay 10> which your kind
calls God...<New>
It is an 'interstellar
invasion weapon system',<New>
created in the ancient
past by the people of
another planet.<New>
An autonomous weapon,<Delay 5>
created to act under its
own will to subjugate any
targeted planet.<New>
I suppose you know that
from looking at the Raziel
records?<New>
During its test run, Deus
went out of control.<Delay 10>
It unleashed its power and
utterly destroyed a planet.<New>
Acknowledging the threat in
the immeasurable battle
potential of the weapon,<New>
Deus' creators forcibly
shut it down.<New>
In order to analyze the
cause of the rampage,
its core was dismantled<New>
and loaded onto an inter-
stellar immigrant ship to
be transported to a planet
in another star system.<New>
The disassembled Deus
resisted.<Delay 20> Mid-flight,
it tried to take over
the immigrant ship.<New>
But unexpectedly,<Delay 5> in the
creators' own act of
retaliation,<Delay 5> the ship is
heavily damaged.<New>
And so it fell to this
planet.<New>
During the descent,<Delay 5>
concluding that it could
not escape annihilation<New>
due to the massive damage
or else the collision with
the planet's surface,<New>
Deus detached its core from
the Zohar power reactor."<Close><End of Block>

Master unit to the slave

"The core that was

the Bio-Computer Kadmoni,<New>
landed on this primitive

Then, so that Deus would
revive once again on the

it used its bio-elements
maintenance plant,

Thus were the first human

Emperor Cain and the Gazel

"Do you know why it was
that the Gazel Ministry
sought the Vessels of Anima<New>
and your fleshly bodies?<New>
Well...<Delay 10>
before becoming humans,<New>
the bodies of the Ministry
were one of the organic
elements in the core
circuit that makes up Deus.<New>
The female type of those
organic elements is called
'Anima',<Delay 5> and the male type
is called 'Animus'.<New>
As mobile terminals,
they also possessed the
capability of fusion with
certain machines,<New>
to perform the role of
terminal weapons of Deus.<New>
Basically, the Omnigears
you were using are one
form of such weapons.<New>
The Ministry, who were
Animus, were meant to unite
with their separated Anima<New>
at the hour of God's
resurrection.<Delay 10> But in the
war 500 years ago, their
physical bodies were lost.<New>
As a result, in order to
become one with the Anima,<New>
they tried to retrieve
their own factors that
lived on in the genes of
their human descendants."<Close><End of Block>

Not simply to repair it.<New>

you are humans who have

In actuality, there
weren't enough components
for Deus...<Delay 20> But Karellen
has compensated for that.<New>
The nanomachines he
produced don't only make
up for the human factors,<New>
