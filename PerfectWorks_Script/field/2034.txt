Regardless, I

<TextBlock 13 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"This Deus,
the one you call God,<New>
is an 'inter-planetary
invasion weapon system'<New>
that was built in ancient
times by humans from
another planet.<New>
It was created as an
autonomous weapon which
could act upon its own will<New>
to take control of a
targeted planet.<New>
But you should've known
this much from looking at
the Raziel records.<New>
During a test run, Deus
became uncontrollable.
It released its power and
annihilated a whole planet.<New>
The creators of Deus found
its immeasurable power to
be too much of a threat,
so forcibly shut it down.<New>
In order to analyze the
cause of the problem,
its core was dismantled and<New>
placed on an interplanetary
emigrant passenger ship,
to be transported to
another planet.<New>
Becoming aware of this, the
dissasembled Deus resisted.<New>
It tried to take over the
passenger ship that was
transporting it.<New>
However, as a last line
of defense against the
escape of Deus,<New>
its creators unexpectedly
destroyed the whole ship,
sending it crashing to
this planet.<New>
Deus knew that it would
not be able to get away
from the explosion or the
imminent impact,<New>
and so it detached its
core from the 'Zohar'
power reactor."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:28 h:2>
Fei
"Zo...har...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, 'Zohar'...
It is what drives all of
the Gears on this planet.<New>
It is the master generator
that transmits its energy
to the slave generators
in our Gears.<New>
It is also the source of
all the Ether power that
the inhabitants of this
planet utilize.<New>
By utilizing the energy
displacements caused by
actualizing potential
future phenomenon...<New>
...this 'Zohar Modifier'
has the ability to produce
infinite amounts of
energy."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 17 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Are you saying all our
energy comes from that one
power reactor or engine?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, but there is more...<New>
The core that was detached 
from Zohar, the 'Biological
Computer Kadmoni' crashed
onto this primitive planet.<New>
It activated 'Persona',
its life support plant,
that can generate organic
material.<New>
Using this it prepared for
itself a genetic-based
system for the day when
Deus would be resurrected.<New>
Thus, the first humans were
created from there...<Delay 20>
Emperor Cain and the elders
of the Gazel Ministry."<Close><End of Block>

"Are you saying the Emperor
and them Gazel geezers were
people born from Deus!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Do you know why the Gazel
Ministry sought the Vessels
of Anima and your bodies?<New>
Well, here's the reason...<Delay 10>
Before becoming human,
the bodies of the Ministry<New>
were once part of the
organic elements in the
core circuit that made
up Deus.<New>
There were two types of
organic elements.<New>
The female type was called
'Anima', while the male
type was called 'Animus'.<New>
They were also created
with the added ability
to become mobile weapons<New>
by merging with machinery
that was suited for use as
terminal interface weapons
for Deus.<New>
In other words, those
Omnigears you were using
were one form of such
weapons.<New>
The Ministry, who were
Animus, were to become
one again with their
separated Anima<New>
at the time of the resurr-
ection of God.<Delay 10> But in a war
500 years ago, they all
lost their physical bodies.<New>
It was then that they
decided to extract their
own genetic factor<New>
from certain individuals
among their human
descendants who carried the
appropriate sets of DNA.<New>
All so each of them could
become one with their
respective Anima again."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 23 w:48 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, you humans are all
descendants of Cain and
the Gazel Ministry...<New>
They were born from the
'Persona', gave birth,
and propagated.<New>
They followed their
inbuilt program to
someday resurrect the
heavily damaged Deus."<Close><End of Block>

to resurrect Deus!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"Yes.<Delay 20>
But it wasn't just to
restore its old body.<New>
More than half of Deus is
constructed of biological
parts.<Delay 20> Do you remember
those mutated humans?<New>
Those are all people who
were destined to become
replacement parts for
Deus."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 27 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, almost all the
people are destined to
become parts for Deus.<New>
But you people gathered
here are all different.<New>
You could say you...
'escaped' that destiny by
existing through multiple
generations...<New>
In actuality, there wasn't
enough parts for Deus...<Delay 20>
But, Karellen compensated
for what was lacking.<New>
The reduction in the number
of parts, was due to humans
living through multiple
generations...<New>
But that deficiency in the
human factor, was made up
for by the nanomachines
created by Karellen.<New>
Not only that, but his
nanomachines added
additional functions.<New>
Deus has thus evolved into
the perfect weapon.<Close><End of Block>

When the previous one dies,
