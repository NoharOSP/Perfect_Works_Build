your Gear has been moved to

"So,<Delay 5> where on earth 
is <Weltall>?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 130 w:56 h:4>
Hammer
"Not 'on earth', but under
the earth! It's in an under-
ground dock in D Block!<New>
I've checked into it and
found out that there are
two routes we can use to
sneak inside.<New>
The first one requires us
to enter via the Battling
Arena grounds."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 131 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Well there's no way we can
sneak in via the Battling
Arena!<Delay 15> What's the second?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 132 w:54 h:4>
Hammer
"The second way is a little
dangerous as it involves
the supply-train tunnel.<New>
You sneak into the ducts
that are inside the tunnel.
Then, if you follow the
ducts carefully...<New>
you'll end up at the
underground dock.<New>
But I couldn't find out
the ducts' layout<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
Sorry, bro."<Close><End of Block>

"<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>Oh that tunnel, huh?<New>
Well, now that we have
the bomb problem off our
necks, we might be able to
make a go of it!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 134 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Yes, but we are still left
with not knowing what times
the trains pass by.<New>
Will a supply train pass by
at a time that is of any
use to us?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 135 w:56 h:4>
Fei
"Not all of this has to be
decided now. Let's take our
time and plan it carefully!"<Close><End of Block>

"Firstly: Hammer, I'm sorry
to put you out, but<Delay 5>...<New>
could you find out for us
the days and times that the
supply trains operate,
please?"<Close><End of Block>

Hammer
"I'll get right on it, bro.<Delay 15>
Well then, I'll be off!"<Close><End of Block>

to D Block for the
time being?"<Close><End of Block>
