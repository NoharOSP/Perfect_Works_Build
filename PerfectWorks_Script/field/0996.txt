Hammer
"Not 'on earth', but under
the earth! It's in an under-
ground dock in D Block!<New>
I've checked into it and 
found out that there are
two routes we can use to 
sneak inside.<New>
The first one requires us
to enter via the Battling
Arena grounds.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 131 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Well there's no way we can
sneak in via the Battling
Arena!<Delay 15> What's the second?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 132 w:54 h:4>
Hammer
"The second way is a little
dangerous as it involves 
the supply train tunnel.<New>
You have to get into the
tunnel's ducts and follow
them right through till
they lead to the docks.<New>
But I couldn't find out
the duct's layout<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
Sorry, bro."<Close><End of Block>

"<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>Oh that tunnel, huh?<New>
Well, now that we have the
bomb problem off of our

make a go of it!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 134 w:54 h:4>

"Yes, but we are still left
with not knowing the times
that the trains pass by on.<New>
Will a supply train pass by
at a time that is of any
use to us?"<Close><End of Block>

"Firstly Hammer, I'm sorry
to put you out, but<Delay 5>...<New>
Could you find out the days
and times that the supply
trains operate on for us
please?"<Close><End of Block>

"I'll get right on it, bro.<Delay 15>
Well then, I'll be off!"<Close><End of Block>
