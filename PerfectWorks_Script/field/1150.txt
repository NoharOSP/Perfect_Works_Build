We have the coordinates

N24, E92, Ignas, in the
Lahan region, the

From the wave pattern,

Yggdrasil seems to be

If they submerge,
they'll have the upper

Any attack we might make
would just be wasted
since they could
simply dive.<New>
But if we eliminate that
function first, it's
still not too late.<New>
I've already made the
