We have the coordinates
of those dimensional
vibrations just now.<New>
N24, E92, Ignis, in the
Lahan region, the
northeast ocean.<New>
From the wave pattern,
it's definitely a Gatekeeper.<Close><End of Block>

Aphel Aura?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:44 h:3>
No. The mass is
different. It's a much
smaller pattern.<Close><End of Block>

I can't believe that
the Lambs have a ship

"Wait.<New>
It appears their mother
ship Yggdrasil also has
the functions of a
submarine.<New>
If it has gained stealth
capability, that's
enough to give it the
upper hand over Haishao.<New>
To even pursue them is
pointless if they can
conceal themselves in
the water.<New>
But it's still not too
late to rob them of that
ability.<New>
I have already...<Delay 10>
taken measures."<Close><End of Block>

It's a trivial matter
