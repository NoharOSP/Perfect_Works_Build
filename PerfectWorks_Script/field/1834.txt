I thought that maybe,<Delay 10>
just maybe, Fei would
understand my feelings<Delay 5>...<New>
I'm not sure whether it
was really love or not...<New>
Maybe I was just forlorn
after losing my mother

it still be love?<Delay 10>
Love<Delay 10> for Fei...<New>
That's why I think, one
more time, he should do
what he can, and I will
too <--><Delay 10> separately.<New>
I want to try taking
a fresh look at one
another by doing so..."<Close><End of Block>

It could be that Solaris
