"...Well...<Delay 50>
It was long ago.<New>
When his Majesty and
I were still young...<New>
Long before his Majesty
knew my young master's
mother.<New>
His Majesty was in love
with a certain girl
from a small religious
sect east of Av.<New>
This sect was quite
different from Nisan and
the 'Church of the Ethos'<New> 
but she was very 
beautiful.<New>
Then...
she just disappeared.
Later there were rumors
of her having a child."<Close><End of Block>
