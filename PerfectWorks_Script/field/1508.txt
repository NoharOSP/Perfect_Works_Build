Maria
"This way, please."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:52 h:2>
We aren't permitted to
leave here no matter what.<New>
So please, take good care
of Maria for us!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:48 h:3>
How's the surface doing,
lately?<New>
I'm sure the people down
there are living blindly
yet peacefully as usual.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:52 h:3>
Are you the newcomers from
the outside?<Delay 20> Maria isn't
with you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:3>
It's truly unfortunate
about Professor Nikola...<New>
But thanks to you all, we
were able to repel the
enemy.<New>
Thank you.<Delay 20> And let's
continue to work together
to take down Solaris!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:54 h:3>
In hopes of making contact
with you and your friends
on the ocean surface...<New>
...the shields were
apparently dropped.<New>
That's when they took
advantage of the situation.<New>
Who would've ever thought
there would actually be a
spy that would get in!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
I seriously doubt any spy
would be able to get in.<New>
And as I expected, since
we have new people from
the surface, there's
increased security.<New>
And you never know what
might happen...<Delay 20> If anything
ever happened to the Queen,
it'd be disastrous.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:3>
We cannot allow you to
come and go unaccompanied
beyond this point.<New>
I am sorry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:4>
This is the library, where
many books are gathered.<New>
This place is packed with
many ancient books that
you cannot find on the
surface.<New>
If you're a book fanatic,
you'd drool over books
like our first run prints,<New>
limited books, autographed
books, banned books,
mountains of hard-to-find
books,<New>
and more mountains and
mountains of books...!<Delay 20>
Ahhh! It's too much!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:54 h:4>
Well, setting that aside...<New>
If there's something you
want to know about from the
past, it'd be good to go in
and talk to the librarians.<New>
Don't worry.<Delay 20> It's their
job anyway to tell the new
people from the surface
about the past.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:42 h:4>
...*Sigh*... Will the
day ever come when we
can live peacefully
on the surface?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:54 h:3>
Welcome to Shevat.<Delay 20> We've
already heard that you are
our guests.<New>
Please use this room as you
please.<Delay 20> You are welcome to
use the bed to rest.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:50 h:3>
When Maria leaves, this
town's going to be just
that much more lonelier.<New>
But, I guess there's no
way around it.<New>
There comes a time, for
everyone, when they must
embark on their own path.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:54 h:4>
Maria has truly done so
much for us. As of now...<New>
...many of us consider her
to be the guardian angel
of Shevat.<New>
Regardless of how well
she can control
<Seibzehn>, she's
only a 13-year-old girl.<New>
She's probably worried sick
about her father who's been
captured by Solaris...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:3>
Who would've ever thought
that would happen to
Professor Nikola...<New>
What are we to say to
Maria?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:52 h:4>
Balthasar firmly told
Maria not to leave Shevat
under any circumstances.<New>
He probably said that
because he knows that if
given half a chance...<New>
...that child would
immediately try to fly off
to Solaris...<New>
All by herself, to rescue
her captured father,
riding on the
<Seibzehn>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:54 h:4>
The powerless are maimed
and slaughtered all because
those crazed leaders give
out one bloodthirsty order.<New>
It doesn't matter how
advanced their technology
or culture is.<New>
It's the same thing. Not
one thing has changed over
the years.<New>
It's gotten so sad, you can
almost laugh! Hah! How long
does this have to last...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:54 h:4>
To protect Shevat from the
outside, the ancient
technology of the Gate is
used.<New>
It's fundamentally the same
thing as the stuff Solaris
has planted on the surface.<New>
Even with Solaris'
technology, the Gate cannot
be broken through.<New>
But at times, I come to
think about whether this
Gate is only for protecting
us from Solaris?<New>
Maybe that man left this
Gate behind to separate us.
To isolate us from the rest
of the world.<New>
If that was his intention,
then Karellen is indeed
dreadful... Does that man's
resentment run that deep...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:48 h:4>
Karellen holds the true
power in Solaris is what
I'm saying... The irony
of fate.<New>
Once, that man fought
alongside Roni Fatima,
Queen Zephyr and Lacan
against Solaris...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:54 h:4>
Uuhhh, so hungry... Is the
meal ready yet?<Delay 20> Whatever
you do, it all goes back to
food. You got that? Food!<New>
For me, I get the feeling
I'm most alive when I'm
eating.<Delay 20> Isn't it the same
with you guys?<New>
You eat to live or live to
eat. We don't even know,
do we?<New>
I bet those Solarians are
always eating all the good
stuff.<Delay 20> Argh!
That's unforgivable!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>
That great war 500 years
ago, I can remember it
like it was yesterday...<New>
It's something I can't
get myself to forget.<New>
Many lives were lost...
Much love, many dreams,
friends...<New>
Those irreplaceably
important things in
our lives were hurt
and left to bleed...<New>
Are those days going to
return once again...?<New>
I don't want my children or
grandchildren to go through
that nightmare...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:3>
You humans are truly
unusual living beings,
aren't chu?<New>
You're all like shattered
fragments of a mirror.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:54 h:4>
Further down is the prison.<Delay 20>
It hasn't been used for
several hundred years
though.<New>
It isn't anything worth
seeing.<New>
Well, I guess you could
say we had a similar
barbaric phase like the
land dwellers!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:52 h:4>
This is the tactical
command room.<New>
Currently, we are keeping
track of the activities of
both Solaris and the
land and collecting data.<New>
However, who would have
thought they'd attack in
such a way...<Delay 20> Aren't they
being a bit hasty?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:54 h:4>
This is the tactical
command room.<New>
Currently, we are keeping
track of the activities of
both Solaris and the
land and collecting data.<New>
Lately, there's been a lot
of unusual activity down on
the surface...<New>
Hmm. You think Solaris
found something?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:48 h:4>
Yeah, that was an
incredible battle.<Delay 20>
Thanks to you all, we're
somehow still here.<New>
Thank you so much.<Delay 20> We're
depending on you till
the day we bring freedom
back to the surface.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:52 h:3>
So you're the newcomers
from the surface?<Delay 20> Hmm...<New>
It seems you all aren't
like the usual land
dwellers we get.<New>
But we're always happy to
have more friends to fight
against Solaris.<New>
I look forward to working
with you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:16 h:3>
Go down?
<Opcode 1 255>    Yes
    No<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:54 h:4>
Oh my, this has gotten
serious.<Delay 20> It seems you can't
get in because of the
emergency security.<New>
But you are all lucky.<Delay 20>
A legendary vendor like
me happens to be here
through coincidence.<New>
I've got a line of quality
goods, sir... So, if you've
got anything you need,<Delay 20>
don't hesitate to ask.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:36 h:2>
Alright, then what
shall it be?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:34 h:4>
<Opcode 1 255>    Items
    Weapons/armor
    Gear parts
    Never mind<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:46 h:4>
Thank you very much.<Delay 20>
If there's anything you
need, please come by
again.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:54 h:4>
I heard that, long ago,
a lone <Chu-Chu> was taken
from the town by a sage...<New>
It looks like she's been
well.<Delay 20> On top of that, she's
gotten so big and grand...<New>
It's truly a surprise!<Delay 20>
Wonder what she was eating.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:4>
I heard that, long ago,
a lone <Chu-Chu> was
taken from the town by
a sage...<New>
I haven't heard what
happened after that.<Delay 20>
I hope that <Chu-Chu>
is doing well...<Close><Close><End of Block>
