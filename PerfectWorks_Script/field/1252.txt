Warship signature
detected.
...<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>It's not
our target.<New>
This type...
It matches with
the Av pirate ship,
Yggdrasil.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:38 h:4>
Dominia
"Yggdrasil?<Delay 10> Wasn't
she sunk in the
earlier battle?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:54 h:4>
There's no record of
its sinking. We were too
busy fighting that red
Gear to try to confirm it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:48 h:3>
Dominia
"Then there is a chance
that it did not sink...<New>
I believe the data shows
the Yggdrasil was that
Gear's mother ship?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:44 h:2>
One moment<Delay 30>...<Delay 30>...<Delay 30>
Yes, that is correct.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:44 h:3>
Dominia
"Excellent.
Give me the controls."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:48 h:3>
Excellent?
What are you planning on
doing?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Dominia
"I'll sink it, of course.
She will never trouble the
commander again."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:4>
Wait! The commander's
orders were to investigate
the disappearance of that
flying battleship.<New>
We can't deviate from 
our mission.<New>
Besides, it's high time we
resupply somewhere.
Fuel is low.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:40 h:3>
Dominia
"We have enough.
I'll take her down."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:44 h:4>
...Urgh...<Delay 10>
Once you start there
is no stopping you,
is there?<New>
I hope you know that
fighting in water is
totally different from
fighting on land.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:36 h:4>
Dominia
"Naturally.<Delay 10>
Sorry about this,
Cherubina."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"Dammit!<New>
I can barely maneuver
in the water, yet their
motion is silky smooth..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:50 h:3>
Fei
"Looks like you're having
a tough fight, Bart."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:30 h:3>
Bart
"Fei!?
You're alive!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:44 h:2>

"Hey, that's my line."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"That Gear is<Delay 10>...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:36 h:4>
Dominia
"Elehayym!
What are you doing
in this place?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:36 h:3>
Elly
"Dominia!?
Why are YOU here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:44 h:4>
Dominia
"Why? We Geburah need
no special reasons to
sink an enemy ship!<New>
These foolish land-
dwelling Lambs need
to be guided by the
exalted ones."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"But why?
How are they different from
we Abelite shepherds?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
Dominia
"To me, it's the same
whether it be Lambs or
Abelites.<New>
There is only the
difference in the
absolute ability of
each individual.<New>
The ignorant must
be lead by the wise.
That is providence.<New>
You too had what it takes
to become an Element, the
embodiment of that
providence!<New>
Why didn't you!?
When you possess that
level of skill!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:46 h:4>
Elly
"...<New>
So you're saying an
ability to bring harm
to the weak is a sign
of the exalted ones!?<New>
I didn't want anything
like that...<Delay 30>
That's all!!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:34 h:3>
Fei
"Elly,
are you alright?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:46 h:4>
Dominia
"That Gear... You're
the one? Hah! So that's
how it is.<New>
How amusing, Elehayym.
All this for a man?<New>
I guess those stories
were true after all.
You were born of those
lowly Lambs."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:48 h:3>
Elly
"Stop!
Don't say another word!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:50 h:4>
Dominia
"Hmph, what are you going
to do about it, you Lamb
mongrel!?<New>
Are you going to use the
power you used in that
incident on me now?<New>
Go ahead. Show me.
Show me your true power!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:30 h:4>
Elly
"...Fine!<New>
If you Geburah
are the
providence of
the wise...<New>
then <Delay 30>I'd rather
be a fool!!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:48 h:4>
Dominia
"So be it. Then you
shall be dealt with as
the traitor you are."<Close><Close><End of Block>
