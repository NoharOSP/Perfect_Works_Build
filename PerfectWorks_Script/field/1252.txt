"Warship signature
detected.<New>
...<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>It's not
our target.<New>
This type...
It matches with
the Av pirate ship,
Yggdrasil."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:38 h:4>
Dominia
"Yggdrasil?<Delay 10> Wasn't
she sunk in the
earlier battle?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:38 h:4>
Blue-Haired Girl
"There's no record
of its sinking.<New>
We were too busy
fighting that red
Gear to try to
confirm it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:48 h:3>
Dominia
"Then there is a chance
that it did not sink...<New>
I believe the data shows
the Yggdrasil was that
Gear's mother ship?"<Close><End of Block>

Blue-Haired Girl
"One moment<Delay 30>...<Delay 30>...<Delay 30>
Yes, that is correct."<Close><End of Block>

"Excellent.
Give me the controls."<Close><End of Block>

Blue-Haired Girl
"Excellent?<Delay 10>
What are you
planning on doing?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Dominia
"I'll sink her, of course.
She will never trouble the
commander again."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:46 h:4>
Blue-Haired Girl
"Wait!<New>
The commander's orders
were to investigate the
disappearance of that
flying battleship.<New>
We can't deviate from 
our mission.<New>
Besides, it's high time
we resupply somewhere.
Fuel is low."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:40 h:3>
Dominia
"We have enough.
I'll take her down."<Close><End of Block>

Blue-Haired Girl
"...Urgh...<Delay 10> Once you
start there is no
stopping you, is there?<New>
I hope you know that
fighting in water is
totally different from
fighting on land."<Close><End of Block>

"Of course.<Delay 10>
Sorry about this,
Cherubina."<Close><End of Block>

I can barely maneuver

a tough fight, Bart."<Close><End of Block>

You're alive!?"<Close><End of Block>

What are you doing
in this place?"<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Dominia!?
Why are YOU here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:44 h:4>
Dominia
"Why? We Geburah need
no special reasons to
sink an enemy ship!<New>
These foolish land-
dwelling Lambs need
to be guided by the
exalted ones."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"But why?
How are they different from
we Abelite shepherds?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
Dominia
"To me, it's the same
whether it be Lambs or
Abelites.<New>
There is only the
difference in the
absolute ability of
each individual.<New>
The ignorant must
be lead by the wise.
That is providence.<New>
You too had what it takes
to become an Element, the
embodiment of that
providence!<New>
Why didn't you!?
When you possess that
level of skill!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:46 h:4>
Elly
"...<New>
So you're saying an
ability to bring harm
to the weak is a sign
of the exalted ones!?<New>
I didn't want anything
like that...<Delay 30>
That's all!!"<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"Elly,
are you alright?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:46 h:4>
Dominia
"That Gear... You're
the one? Hah! So that's
how it is.<New>
How amusing, Elehayym.
All this for a man?<New>
I guess those stories
were true after all.
You were born of those
lowly Lambs."<Close><End of Block>

Don't say another word!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:50 h:4>
Dominia
"Hmph, what are you going
to do about it, you Lamb
mongrel!?<New>
Are you going to use the
power you used in that
incident on me now?<New>
Go ahead. Show me.
Show me your true power!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:30 h:4>
Elly
"...Fine!<New>
If you Geburah
are the
providence of
the wise...<New>
then <Delay 30>I'd rather
be a fool!!"<Close><End of Block>

"So be it. Then you
shall be dealt with as
the traitor you are."<Close><Close><End of Block>
