"Roni Fatima?<Delay 10> Isn't he
an ancestor of mine?<New>
So you're saying my
ancestor Roni fought
alongside Queen Zephyr
against Solaris...?<New>
Hmm..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:54 h:3>
At one point, Solaris
and its Gazel Ministry
of twelve elders<New>
dominated the world
with more military might
than they have presently.<New>
The people on the land were
treated like slaves...<New>
If anyone resisted,
they were quickly and
mercilessly dealt with.<New>
They treated the people as
if they weren't living
beings.<New>
Eventually, people on
the surface from all
quarters began to rebel,<New>
ultimately leading to the
Solaris-Shevat War of 500
years ago.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:54 h:4>
The great war that unfolded
between Solaris and Shevat,
500 years ago...<New>
It was a heroic battle,
with the freedom and
independence of the land
dwellers at stake...<New>
The rebel army, which
centered around Shevat,<New>
was successful in their
assault on the Solaris
stronghold, despite
tremendous sacrifices...<New>
However, on the very
edge of victory, the
unthinkable happened...<New>
A new enemy appeared that
even Solaris had not
anticipated.<New>
That was when the nightmare
began. A nightmare never
seen before.<New>
A nightmare that we pray we
will never have to see
again...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:56 h:4>
Diabolos...<New>
500 years ago, the sudden
appearance of the mysterious
army brought to a halt the
battle between the humans.<New>
Those angels of death,
utterly unrivaled, with no
fear or mercy...<New>
Their only intention was to
eradicate all life on this
planet.<New>
Even Solaris' proudest
Gear battalions were as
mere insects to them.<New>
Nothing stopped them as
they indiscriminately
slaughtered and trampled
upon countless lives.<New>
At that time, people were
certain that the end of the
world was approaching...<New>
Dominated by feelings of
constant fear and
hopelessness, they were
dreadful days...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:54 h:4>
500 years ago, mankind was
able to make it through and
survive certain death,<New>
thanks to the power
of the giants created
through God's wisdom.<New>
Roni Fatima and the other
young fighters piloted
these giants,<New>
and defeated the being at
the heart of the mysterious
Diabolos army.<New>
Seeing an opportunity to
counterattack, mankind
desperately stood up
against Diabolos...<New>
...and successfully
annihilated them.<New>
Roni Fatima, Queen Zephyr
and the rest of the young
ones had put their lives
on the line,<New>
and won us back a future
for this world.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:54 h:4>
Those giants which fought
long ago to save us.
Entities surpassing
all other Gears.<New>
They are the legendary
'Omnigears'.<New>
One of them is the treasure
of the Av royal family, and
currently rests somewhere
on the continent of Ignis.<New>
But we don't know where,
exactly.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:50 h:4>
Just like the land
dwellers, after the
war and the Diabolos
Collapse,<New>
the heavily beaten
Solaris forces began to
pull back and return to
their home country,<New>
taking vast numbers of
land dwellers along with
them as slaves.<Delay 20>
We couldn't stop them.<New>
The only way for the war-
weary land dwellers to
survive was to depend on
Solaris...<New>
After a brief moment of
hope, Solaris had once
again taken control of
our lives...<New>
A cold and harsh era had
begun.<New>
500 years have passed
and their reign still
continues...<New>
No one knows how long
this is going to last...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:54 h:4>
Surviving through the great
war of 500 years ago and
the Diabolos Collapse...<New>
...we and the rest of the
our comrades secluded
ourselves on Shevat.<New>
At the time, Shevat was
being constructed at the
tip of Babel Tower...<New>
...but we were able to
escape to the sky before
Solaris once again ascended
to power over the land.<New>
Since then, we've been
wandering the skies, while
overlooking the activities
of the land below.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:4>
You're probably already
aware of this...<New>
...but this Shevat is
protected by a special
Gate, made possible by
an ancient technology.<New>
Even Solaris cannot break
this barrier. Because of
that, we were able to avoid
being invaded to this day.<New>
But even with that, we
don't have the power to
attack Solaris either...<New>
It's a stalemate.
Basically, we've just been
glaring at each other.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:54 h:5>
After the war, Solaris
used Gates like ours
to separate itself from
the surface.<New>
And then, they erased all
memory of their existence
from the surface dwellers.<New>
Due to this, the surface
dwellers are still not
aware that they've been
secretly dominated by
Solaris all along.<New>
To be born into a false
reality, to grow up in it,
and to die in it...without
ever approaching the truth.<New>
...That is the life of a
surface dweller.<Close><Close><End of Block>
