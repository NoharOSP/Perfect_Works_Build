Oh, and you are...?<Delay 20>
I feel like I've met you
before...<New>
Hmm...you resemble Khan,
the one who taught us the
art of fighting.<New>
Nobody knows his
whereabouts since he went
down to the surface on
the Queen's mission...<New>
I doubt anything bad has
befallen him, considering
his skills.<Delay 20>
But I wonder where he is?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:50 h:4>
You just arrived from
the surface, didn't
you?<Delay 20>
I've heard about you.<New>
They say you saved our
colleague captured by the
Church.<Delay 20> Thank you very
much for that.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:46 h:4>
I wish they'd give me a
mission!<Delay 20> 
I'd teach those
Solarians a lesson...<Close><Close><End of Block>
