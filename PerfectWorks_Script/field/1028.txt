They say he just got here!"<Close><End of Block>

So, what on earth has this
new doctor got to do with 
you, the great 'supplier'?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 175 w:56 h:4>
Hammer
"What are you talking about
bro?<Delay 15> Of course I have
everything to do with him!<New>
If I become chums with him,
I can expand my connections
by establishing black market
medical treatment routes!"<Close><End of Block>

And Fei has been proved

And I guess the
out-of-bounds order on the
sewers was lifted straight
after that too <Delay 5>...<New>
Anyway, my allying with you
ends here<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
