village. Everyone there
treated me like family.<New>
Then, last night, a group
of Gears suddenly appeared
and started fighting right
in the middle of the place.<New>
The village was engulfed in
flames... I couldn't just
stand there and watch
Lahan be destroyed...so...<New>
To try to save the villag-
ers, I got in an abandoned
Gear...without even knowing
how to operate it.<New>
I just thought maybe I
could do it... No...it
was more like someone
whispering to me...<New>
telling me to do it...
But it was a disaster!
The village..."<Close><End of Block>

you destroyed it?<New>

"I did try to help.
I actually took out
a few Gears.<New>
But then I came under
heavy fire from a new
group of Gears...<New>
And then my friend...<Delay 10>
Timothy...<Delay 10>was hit by
a hail of bullets..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:52 h:4>

"Then... I don't remember

The machine went out

Well, that's what Doc

"If they had never come
to the village, never
started fighting there...<New>
Then I wouldn't have
tried to pilot that Gear.<New>
No one from the village
would have gotten dragged

fault. Not mine!<New>

<TextBlock 32 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, that's right!<New>
So maybe the direct cause
of the battle was those
Gears making an emergency
landing.<New>
But Kislev were only after
those Gears, right?
They weren't out to invade
Lahan or harm its people.<New>
No... The villagers...
They died because you 
had to pilot the Gear 
and start fighting!"<Close><End of Block>

into a Gear you can't even
ride!?<New>
Not just anyone can pilot 
those machines, you know!<New>
There is no way an
untrained civilian could
hope to operate one!<New>
Not to mention...shouldn't
you really have been
helping the villagers
evacuate or something?<New>
How can you blame those
downed Gears for it all
when in the end it was you
who stirred up the enemy?<New>
Why won't you take 
responsibility? Why are 
you trying to put the 
blame on others?<New>
That's just running away!
You're a coward!"<Close><End of Block>

"Yeah...maybe that...<New>
That's right!
I'm a coward!<Delay 60>
I've known it all along.<New>
I didn't realize my own
strength and have been
blaming others for the
consequences.<New>
I'm a pitiful excuse for a

for some reason, I just
felt this wild rush of<New>

What do you know!?<New>
When I came to, I was
surrounded by piles
of rubble...<New>
I remembered absolutely
nothing about what
happened or what I did.<New>
And yet...in my hands...
there's this sensation
that lingers.<New>
Even the thick bulkhead
of a Gear couldn't have
blocked out the screams,<New>
the stench of blood, the
sound of bones shattering
and the voices cursing
me...<Close><End of Block>

Look! Look at my hands!
Do you know this
sensation!? Can you hear
the voices!?<New>
This feeling of having
destroyed my village

This feeling, when faced
with the kids left behind,
that there was nothing I
could do for them...<New>
I don't even have anywhere
to go back to...
Or anyone..."<Close><End of Block>
