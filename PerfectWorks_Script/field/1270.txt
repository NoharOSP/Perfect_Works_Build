How old was I...?<Delay 10>
I don't remember.
Maybe 8 or 9. <New>
About then,
dad taught me
how to use a gun.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:32 h:2>
One day
dad disappeared.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:44 h:1>
He just ran out on us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:38 h:1>
He never came back.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:3>
Even so,
I stayed in his room alone
often.<New>
Dad's gun,<Delay 10> 
Dad's smell.<Delay 10><New>
Those things were all
I had left to
remind me of him.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:38 h:2>
But that happiness 
didn't last long...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:50 h:4>
When I was 12,
my house was attacked
by Reapers
and mom was killed.<New>
They were looking for dad
but mom wouldn't talk.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:56 h:3>
I can still hear it...<Delay 10> 
The sound of the bullets
slowly firing three times...<New>
I even remember the sound
of the empty shells
hitting the floor.<New>
After that,
the Reapers screamed
and I heard someone fall.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:2>
Bishop Stone was the one 
who helped us then.<Delay 10><New>
Meeting him changed my life
from then on.<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"Hey, hey, wait a sec.<Delay 10> 
Do Reapers talk?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"Wait a minute.<Delay 10> 
Reapers spoke in a human
language?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:52 h:4>
"Yes.<Delay 10>
They're not just monsters.
Some of them are more
intelligent than humans."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:48 h:4>
Primera and I hid in the
shadows escaping death,
but she hasn't spoken a
word since. <Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:52 h:4>
Like a godsend, kind,
strong Bishop Stone gave
me an example to follow.<New>
I wanted to help save
someone in need like
he saved us.<New>
I didn't want there to
be any more children
like Primera...<New>
So I began training at the
Church of the Ethos to 
become just like Bishop 
Stone.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:46 h:4>
I left Prim in the care
of the Church of the 
Ethos and entered the 
monastery.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:40 h:1>
Many years passed...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:40 h:3>
I finished training
at the monastery and
became an Etone.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:40 h:2>
I returned home to
open the orphange...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:46 h:2>
And he...<Delay 10>had
unexpectedly come back.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:3>
But he was different.<Delay 10>
Some terrible accident
changed him. <New>
Not only his looks, but
his character and manner
had entirely changed too.<New>
I remembered him as a
quiet man...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:50 h:3>
But...<Delay 10> more than that,
I thought maybe I didn't 
really remember him...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:48 h:3>
That's why...<Delay 10>
I can never think of him
as a father...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:52 h:3>
But Prim needed a father, 
and she'd become attached
to him.<New>
Deep in my heart, I too
thought I wanted a father.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:44 h:4>
But...<Delay 10>
even now I just can't 
believe he is my real 
father.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:54 h:5>
Stone
"4 years ago...
After searching to the ends
of the earth, no trace of
him could be found."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:48 h:3>
Stone
"Racquel, dirtied by
him<Delay 5>...<Delay 5><New>
and the reminder of that
taint...<Delay 30>you and
your sister<Delay 30>..."<Close><End of Block>
