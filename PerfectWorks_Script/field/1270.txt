<TextBlock 1 w:36 h:3>
How old was I
at the time...?<New>
I don't really
remember.<Delay 10>
Maybe 8 or 9.<New>
It was around then
that Dad taught me
how to use a gun.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:28 h:2>
One day, Dad
disappeared.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:48 h:1>
He just ran out on us...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:38 h:1>
He never came back.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:3>
It was a horrible shock
even for my young mind,<New>
but I couldn't bring
myself to cry.<New>
Because I still had
Mom and Prim.<New>
Even so, I stayed in
Dad's room alone often.<New>
His gun,<Delay 10>
his smell...<Delay 10><New>
From within those things
he had left behind,<New>
I would try to get some
small sense of<Delay 10> 'a father'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:46 h:2>
But even that happiness
didn't last long...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:50 h:4>
When I was 12, the house
was suddenly attacked by
a group of Wels, and Mom
was killed.<New>
They wanted to know Dad's
whereabouts, but Mom
wouldn't talk.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:54 h:3>
I can still hear it...<Delay 20>
The sound of the bullets
Mom fired in retaliation...<New>
Three shots slowly
ringing out...<New>
I even remember the sound
of the empty shells
hitting the floor.<New>
But then the Wels
cried out,<Delay 10> and I
heard someone fall.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:48 h:3>
It was Bishop Stone who
rescued us that day.<New>
It'd be fair to say our
fortunes changed from
that meeting onwards.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:46 h:3>
Bart
"Hey, hey, wait a sec.<Delay 10> 
Do Wels talk?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Please wait a moment.<Delay 10> 
Wels can speak in a
human language?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:52 h:3>
Billy
"Yes.<Delay 10>
They're not just monsters.<New>
Some of them are more
intelligent than humans."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:48 h:4>
Primera and I hid,
and so escaped death,<Delay 10>
but she hasn't spoken
a word since.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:52 h:4>
Like a godsend, kind,
strong Bishop Stone gave
me an example to follow.<New>
I wanted to save others
from evil people the way
he saved us.<New>
I didn't want any
more children to end
up like Primera...<New>
So I began training at the
Church of the Ethos in
order to become just like
Bishop Stone someday.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:46 h:3>
I left Prim in the care
of the Church and
entered the monastery.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:40 h:1>
Many years passed...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:40 h:3>
I finished training
at the monastery and
became an Etone.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:40 h:3>
I returned home to
open the orphanage,<Delay 10>
and shortly after...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:46 h:2>
He...<Delay 10> Dad<Delay 10> unexpectedly
came back.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:3>
But he was different.<Delay 10>
Some terrible accident
had disfigured his face.<New>
Not only that, but his
character and manner had
completely changed too.<New>
The Dad I remembered had
been a quiet man, but...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:52 h:3>
No...<Delay 10>I'd rather think
maybe it was me who didn't
remember him clearly...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:48 h:3>
That's why...<Delay 10>
I still can't think of
him as my real father...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:52 h:3>
But Prim needs a father,
and as a matter of fact
she's really taken to him.<New>
I think, deep down, I
myself do want to have
a father, too.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:44 h:4>
But...<Delay 10>
even now I have a hard
time believing that's
really my dad.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:54 h:5>
Stone
"4 years ago...
After searching to the ends
of the earth, no trace of
him could be found."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:48 h:3>
Stone
"Racquel, dirtied by
him<Delay 5>...<Delay 5><New>
and the reminder of that
taint...<Delay 30>you and
your sister<Delay 30>..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:52 h:4>
Stone
"Through Karellen's wisdom,
using the Wels, I saved
Racquel from misery..."<Close><End of Block>
