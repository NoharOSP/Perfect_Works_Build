Driving back Solaris'
intercepting forces, we set
our sights on the surfaced
continent, Machanon.
 
It was the central hull
of a colossal spacecraft
that must have been at
least 40 kelts across.
 
From the condition of the
hull, we judged this ship
to be many thousands of
years old.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:62 h:23>
'We are alien beings who
came to this world from
another celestial body
long ago...'
 
Could it be that, at one
time, our ancestors had
been aboard this ship and
landed on this planet...?
 
Upon examination of
the interior, we
deduced that the ship
had crash-landed on
this planet due to
some kind of incident
around 10,000 years
earlier.
 
Seeking God <--> and God's
wisdom, 'Raziel's Tree' <-->
which were said to lie
in this Machanon,
we proceeded further in.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:46 h:19>
In the depths,
we beheld an
abnormal<Delay 5> 'thing'.<Delay 10>
A giant grotesque
being, rotting and
partly petrified...
 
'It' cast a mysterious
air of intimidation
upon us.
 
Perhaps that was the
fear of 'the Absolute',
etched in the very
depths of our genes...
 
And then<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
'it' attacked us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:48 h:14>
In the end, the giant
decaying being had
destroyed itself.
 
We proceeded even
further in.
 
The place we arrived at
was a vast cavern <-->
large enough to contain
the Royal Capital of Av.
In its center was
a pair of faintly
shining objects.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:15>
There could be no
doubt this was the
source of God's
wisdom <--><Delay 10> Raziel's Tree.
 
And the cavern itself
was a mega-computer
called Raziel.
 
The wisdom of God,<Delay 5>
hidden within Raziel...
When we accessed its
data, we learned the
extraordinary things
recorded there.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:54 h:9>
Wandering from star system
to star system, an array
comprising a large-scale,
unmanned strategic weapon
and its terminal weapons.
And the gargantuan
mother ship the size
of a peninsula, used for
their transportation...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:56 h:14>
The weapons array was called<Delay 60>
 
   the Interstellar
   Strategic-Integration
   Weapon System<Delay 10> 'Deus'.
 
The construction of a divine
ark... The creation of the
angels, the Malakhim <--> a
divine army to reign over
the universe...
 
What the Gazel Ministry
searched for was right here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:48 h:5>
The data indicated that
the giant decaying being
we defeated previously
was in fact the nucleus
of this system.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:56 h:12>
Then, just as we were about
to try to access the data
for the entity that was both
the power reactor and the
central neural circuit,
driving everything from the
weapons array to the mother
ship <--> an object called<Delay 10>
 
        'Zohar'...<Delay 60>
 
HE appeared.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:52 h:9>
Grahf, Karellen<Delay 5>...<Delay 5> It was
