I am the being<Delay 10>

I am the beginning and

The first and the last.<Close><End of Block>

<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>God?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:62 h:6>
God<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
Some would refer to me as that.
From a certain point of view,
it is right to view me as such.
But at the same time, I am not.
I<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>am also a part of you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:26 h:1>
A part of me?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:58 h:6>
I am defined by how people
observe me.
You are actually talking to
a virtual version of me that
you yourself create...
I am 'your perception' of me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:46 h:3>
I don't understand what
you are talking about.
Who, or what, are you?<Close><End of Block>

<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>EXISTENCE.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:20 h:1>
Existence?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:62 h:8>
In actuality, I do not have
a physical form.
I am an 'Existence' of a
higher dimension.
A place you cannot perceive...
But in terms you understand, it
is a world where everything
acts as kinds of waves...<New>
It is the place that 
became the origin of your 
four-dimensional universe<Delay 5>
which is controlled by 
space and time.<Delay 5>
The fluctuating 
non-existence<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
The 'Wave Existence'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:64 h:2>
What does such an 'Existence'<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
have to do with me...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:62 h:7>
In ancient times, a phenomena 
modification engine, a 
semi-perpetual infinite energy 
engine was created. It was 
given the name "Zohar".<New>
It was the attempt by ancient 
people from a different planet 
to obtain the highest energy 
imaginable in this 
four-dimensional universe.<New>
It was not long before those 
people made use of this engine 
to create the ultimate 
strategic weapon for 
interplanetary war, "Deus". 
Zohar was eventually used 
as its main power reactor.<New>
But the unexpected happened...
During the connection tests of
Zohar with the newly completed
Deus, the engine started to
examine infinite potential
phenomena...<New>
Requiring energy, the engine
connected this dimension to
the higher dimensional space.
As a result, that reactor
'merged' or 'synchronized'
with the wave existence in
that higher dimension<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>ME.<New>
I 'descended' from the point
of contact created by the
machine through the 'Path
of Sephirot', or the domain
you are in right now, and
incarnated in the four-
dimensional world.<New>
After I 'Advented' to the four-
dimensional world, in order to
stabalize myself here, I had
to exchange, or materialize,
my form and enter into the
'modifier' engine...<New>
In other words, I became bound
in 'Zohar'... the 'cage of
fleshly existence'.<New>
Since the time I was bound in
Zohar, I have always wanted to
return to my own dimension...
And I came to a conclusion.<New>
I had to reverse the process
I went through to arrive here.
I must be released by the one
who instilled within me a
special feature of this
dimension - the 'will'...
That one is you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:38 h:2>
Decided it was me?
A special feature??<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:62 h:5>
Yes.
I was given a special attribute
of a human by you, the Contact,
when you observed me...
I was given<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>a mother's will.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:32 h:1>
A mother's will?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:50 h:4>
I'm sure you remember.
After my descent, you had
contact with the modifier
engine, 'Zohar'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:4 h:1>
!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:62 h:6>
As a contact, being but only a
child, you defined my existence
with your desire to return to
your mother. Thus I came to
prepare the mother's will...
That will is Elehayym.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:44 h:2>
Elly's disposition was
influenced by me?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:60 h:9>
Yes.
My will was incarnated through
a bio-computer which was vital
for Deus.
After combining with me, the
bio-computer evolved its
functions, and that bio-plant
generated a central element.
That is her.<New>
I was split by your contact.
My physical form or flesh
stayed in Zohar, while my
will went into Elehayym and
my power went into you.
That's why I waited to
unite with you.
And now, it is fulfilled.<New>
My only remaining desire
is to break this 'cage
of fleshly existence'...
In order to do that, I must
become perfect by combining
with Elehayym, as well as my
other split physical form,
'Deus'.<New>
The only way to return to
my original dimension is to
destroy this physical body.
In the four-dimensional world,
Zohar is perfect, so in order
to destroy Zohar I need the
strength that was attributed
to you...<New>
Zohar can only be destroyed
by the hands of the 'Contact'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:52 h:3>
What about Elly?
If Zohar is destroyed,
what will become of Elly!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:56 h:8>
Zohar and Deus are one.
She is bound to the system
by another's will to become
one with me.
In order to release her, it
is necessary to destroy that
very system that serves as
the Deus weapon...<New>
However, having been created
as a weapon, the Deus system
seeks to unify itself with
all of you for a different
purpose than that of mine.<New>
Originally, her release
should have been performed
by me, the one who desires
to return back to the higher
dimension...
But, I am also bound to the
system just as she is, so I
am unable to participate.<New>
You are the only one who
can release her from the
spell.
Just as Deus and I are
inseparable, you and her
are also inseparable.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:42 h:4>
<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>Alright.<Delay 10>
I'll destroy Deus and
the Zohar modifier.<Delay 10>
And<Delay 10> I'll save Elly.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:60 h:5>
You have experienced much loss
and deprivation in your life.
It is very tragic.<New>
Our contact, and the resulting
transference of power and will
between you and I, most likely
played a factor in splitting
your personality.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:54 h:4>
I disagree.
I can't blame anything
or anyone besides myself.<New>
Regardless of what may have
happened in the past, with
the passing of time the
cause becomes more remote.<New>
It is a problem that comes
from within myself, that I
myself must deal with...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:56 h:6>
I see...
You have managed to accept
those tragedies, to tolerate
all things, to comprehend
and find where you stand in
this world.<New>
If you have succeeded to
do all these things, I am
sure you will succeed in
what awaits you now.<Close><End of Block>
