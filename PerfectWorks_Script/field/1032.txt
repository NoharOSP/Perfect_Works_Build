He's the undefeated king,

I still don't like Gears.
That much hasn't changed.<New>
When I pilot them, I become

I don't want to think of it!<New>
But at the same time, it is
also a connection with some
lost 'part' of me.<New>
With this in mind, recently
I decided I would see it
through to the end.<New>
Elly had also been troubled

it, nothing will improve!"<Close><End of Block>
