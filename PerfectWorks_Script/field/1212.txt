There is only one gate left

Isn't that all it takes?"<Close><End of Block>

smugglers<New>
and did not have the time
to look out the window.<New>
On top of that,
when going through the
gate from Solaris,<New>
we transferred to other
places by using the
environmental plane
between each gate.<New>
Remember when we made
contact with the Kislev
gate in the Goliath?<New>
The same thing happens

where we were before."<Close><End of Block>

Like mountains, jungles

Then it can't be the
north?<New>
This is the pole. It's

"Then it's settled.<Delay 10>
The location of the gate
is south of here.<New>
The center of the triangle

If the gates are placed
in the highest point in the
north, the center will be
the continent.<New>
Hence, it coincides with

It is a submarine but
not a bathyscaphe.<New>
It isn't made for deep
