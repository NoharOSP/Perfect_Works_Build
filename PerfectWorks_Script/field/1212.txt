We did not have the
luxury of looking
out the window.<New>
On top of that,
as you exit the Gate
out of Solaris you
'jump' to some other<New>
place entirely <-->
an effect of crossing
the boundary between
two Gates.<New>
You may recall when
Kislev's Gatekeeper-
equipped vessel,<New>
the Goliath<Delay 5>...umm<Delay 5>...

Similar to that, one

"Even if it is split
off from other places
by the Gates,<New>
don't you at least
have a sense of the

mountain range,
or is it covered
by jungle?"<Close><End of Block>

So doesn't that rule
out the north?<New>
That way's the pole,

be all around, never
mind the ocean."<Close><End of Block>

"Then the Gate's location
has got to be in the south.<New>
In this triangle, there'd
be nothing but ocean at the
center.<Delay 10> That would fit with
what Elly just told us.<New>
Whereas, if the Gate was
positioned at the northern
point, then the center
would be over a continent."<Close><End of Block>

It's a submarine,
