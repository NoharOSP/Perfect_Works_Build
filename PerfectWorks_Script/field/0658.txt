Speaking of which, there

"Just as I thought...<New>
Gears making an emergency 
landing in Lahan, a pilot 
who disappeared,<New> 
and at the same time a 
mysterious girl wandering 
in the forest...<New>
These are no mere 
oincidences.<New>
Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the Geburah military.<New>
Perhaps a lieutenant...
Am I correct?"<Close><End of Block>

Who are you?"<Close><End of Block>

Fei knows little of the

I would like to protect

Elly, you do not belong

Go home to your people."<Close><End of Block>

I will not do anything

your true identity to
Fei.<New>
I will just tell him

came for you."<Close><End of Block>

I said something

showing up ultimately 
got Lahan destroyed.<New>
He kept saying...
 'If only they
  hadn't come...'<New>
Because of that, I 
called Fei a coward<New>

escape his own burden 
of responsibility."<Close><End of Block>

All those innocent people

involved. Yet... I 
accused Fei..."<Close><End of Block>

they not...?"<Close><End of Block>

a responsiblity to Fei

Why is that?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:3>
Elly
"I don't know, myself...<New>
At Jugend I was taught
that surface dwellers
were stupid and base...<New>

us to control them...<Delay 20>
But..."<Close><End of Block>

something about him made
you feel otherwise?"<Close><End of Block>

than we are... In fact, 
he seemed even tougher.<New>
He has something...

me, of all people."<Close><End of Block>

father's influence.<New>

surface dwellers.<New>
My nanny... was a surface
dweller. No one knew about
that though...<New>
And also...
Fei and I are alike..."<Close><End of Block>

I am sorry. After just
saying we should not pry...<New>
It is my nature, you know?
My wife says I am too
persistent and that I
talk too much,<New>
But personally, I
don't think it is that 
much...."<Close><End of Block>

it is probably best
