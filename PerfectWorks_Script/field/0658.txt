The missing pilot from the
Gear that made an emergency
landing in Lahan...<New>

found wandering lost in the
forest...are actually one

Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the Geburah military.<New>
Perhaps a lieutenant...
Am I correct?"<Close><End of Block>

Who are you?"<Close><End of Block>

So how come..."<Close><End of Block>

Go back to your family."<Close><End of Block>

I will...just tell him
you went to meet up

our fault your village
was destroyed.<New>
Fei kept saying...
 'if only they

coward because he was
trying to escape from
the responsibility...<New>

me who was trying to
escape from taking
the blame..."<Close><End of Block>

But I accused Fei..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei and the villagers.<New>
Why is that?"<Close><End of Block>

At Jugend I was taught

something about him made
you feel differently?"<Close><End of Block>

my father. He had an open

I am the same as Fei..."<Close><End of Block>
