You have had quite a day."<Close><End of Block>

"This is the machine Fei
boarded when Lahan was
attacked.<New>
Speaking of which, there
was one other machine,
abandoned on the outskirts

Nil baya dars legus?

"Just as I thought...<New>
Gears making an emergency
landing in Lahan, a pilot
who disappeared,<New>
and at the same time a
mysterious girl wandering
in the forest... These are
no mere coincidences.<New>
Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the Geburah military.
Perhaps a lieutenant...<New>
Am I correct?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:26 h:3>
Elly
"How...?
Who are you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"I checked the ID tags of
of the soldiers who died
in the attack on Lahan...<New>
The design on their tags

uniform there are almost
the same."<Close><End of Block>

Although, they may not

about you?"<Close><End of Block>

realizes."<Close><End of Block>

Fei knows little of the
world outside of Lahan."<Close><End of Block>

I have a favor I must
beg of you..."<Close><End of Block>

from here you will reach
the main path.<New>
Then, just keep going...
Would you please leave us

bad things are happening
around Fei for a reason.<New>
I would like to protect
him if possible... I do
not want him caught up in
a needless conflict.<New>
I am saying this for your
benefit, too:
Elly, you do not belong
in this place.<New>
Go home to your people."<Close><End of Block>

"Do not worry.<New>
I will not do anything
that would reveal your
true identity to Fei.<New>
I will just tell him...
that your family came
for you."<Close><End of Block>

"It's not about that!
I said something
terrible to Fei...<New>
So...I want to...
tell him...that I'm
sorry."<Close><End of Block>

"Fei told me that us
showing up ultimately
got Lahan destroyed.<New>
He kept saying...
 'If only they
  hadn't come...'<Delay 30>
Because of that,<New>
I called Fei a coward
for just wanting to
escape his own burden
of responsibility."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"If I hadn't crash-landed
in that village,<New>
it would have remained a
peaceful place. All those
innocent people wouldn't
have gotten involved.<New>
Yet... I accused Fei..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"You are a rarity. The
people 'there' are not
supposed to think that way.<New>
To them, surface dwellers
are nothing more than
domesticated animals,
no...?"<Close><End of Block>

death as they see fit...'"<Close><End of Block>

"Exactly. Yet you feel
a responsibility to Fei
and the villagers.<New>
Why is that?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:3>
Elly
"I don't know,
myself...<New>
At Jugend I was taught
that surface dwellers
were stupid and base...<New>
Hence the need for us
to control them...<Delay 20>
But..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:48 h:4>

"But upon meeting Fei,
something about him made
you feel otherwise?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:46 h:4>
Elly
"Yes. He's not all that
different from us...<New>
If anything, he seemed
even tougher.
He has something...<Delay 10>
Something we don't.<New>
He also put himself at
risk twice fighting for
me, of all people."<Close><End of Block>

"Your people would
normally feel dishonored
by such a deed.<New>
But you are grateful
to Fei.<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"I think maybe it's my
father's influence.<New>
He had an open mind about
surface dwellers.<New>
My nanny...was a surface
dweller. No one knew about
that, though...<New>
And also...
Fei and I are alike..."<Close><End of Block>

Never mind..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:54 h:4>

"Hmm. I think I understand.
I am sorry. After just
saying we should not pry...<New>
It is my nature, you know?
My wife says I am too
persistent and that I talk
too much.<New>
But personally, I do not
think it is that much..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:40 h:4>
Citan
"Anyway...<New>
as things stand
it is probably best
if you return home
to your country.<New>
You really should
not be here."<Close><End of Block>

headquarters.
But then what...?"<Close><End of Block>
