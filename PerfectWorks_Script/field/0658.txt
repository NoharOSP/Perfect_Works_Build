The missing pilot from the
Gear that made an emergency
landing in Lahan...<New>

found wandering lost in the
forest...are actually one

Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the Geburah military.<New>
Perhaps a lieutenant...
Am I correct?"<Close><End of Block>

Who are you?"<Close><End of Block>

Go back to your family."<Close><End of Block>

you went to meet up

our fault your village

Fei kept saying...
 'if only they

coward because he was
trying to escape from
the responsibility...<New>

me who was trying to
escape from taking
the blame..."<Close><End of Block>

Why is that?"<Close><End of Block>
