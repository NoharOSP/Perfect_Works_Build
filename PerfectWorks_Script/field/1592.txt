people who had newly mutated...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:40 h:2>
People mutating, one
after the other...<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Thank you.<Delay 30>
But I'm alright.<New>
I'd rather keep busy,

But why do you have
it, Elly?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:48 h:4>

"Enough of that, now.
Flattery will get you

these other people, too.<New>
We can't afford to let
anyone change further
