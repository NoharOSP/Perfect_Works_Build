<Opcode 1 255>'A discussion on the
excavated Slave Generators 
and their special effects'.<New>
Strange engines discovered
in structures buried under-
ground in ancient times, the
'Sub-' or 'Slave' Generators
(hereafter abbreviated as 
'SG') have, after diverse
study, become widely known to
have their output divided
into three levels.<New>
However, it has been
ascertained that a higher
mode exists that far surpasses
these output levels.
For convenience's sake we 
shall call this 'Hyper Mode'.<New>
Hyper Mode is invoked at a
certain probability when an
SG's attack level reaches 3.
The explanation below
covers the various conditions
and probabilities for
invocation that we have been
able to ascertain at present,
assuming that an SG has been
installed into a humanoid
fighting machine (or 'Gear').<New>
In all cases, a basic
constant exists, which we
observe to be approximately
the value of 5. 
The probability is computed
by multiplying this constant
by one tenth of the
percentage that HP has
been reduced.<New>
For example, if a Gear's HP
has been reduced by 50% of
its total, then the chance of
invocation would be
     5 x 50/10 = 25(%)
So in this case, when the
Attack Level reaches 3,
there is a 25% chance that
Hyper Mode will set in
motion.<New>
Also, apart from this, there
are modification values,
which are added to the basic
value accordingly with the 
release of each attack from 
levels 1 to 3.
In other words, the chances
of Hyper Mode being invoked 
increases the more a Gear 
attacks and the more the Gear
is attacked.<New>
The SG's Hyper Mode induced
by the aforementioned
probability can emit
immeasurable amounts of
energy, so from that aspect
may appear ideal for use as
the master engine of a
fighting machine.<New>
However, in reality they
have not yet progressed
to the point of being used
as a force for actual warfare,
for reasons such as their
unpredictability and
the fact that no Gear frame
exists that is rigid enough
to possibly endure these
energy emissions.<Close><Close><End of Block>
