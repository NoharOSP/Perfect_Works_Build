"'Solaris Third-Class
citizen level F block'.<New>
There're around twenty
blocks in total, each with
land dwellers segregated
within them.<New>
We Solarians have a
molecular-scale tag
that contains all our
personal info,<New>
right down to our DNA
structure.<Delay 10> Our citizen
class is on there, too...<New>
Do you know what the people
living here are called?"<Close><End of Block>

"'Worker bees'.<Delay 10> The name
came from the shape of
these housing compartments.<New>
These people form the
vital workforce that
supports the very
foundations of Solaris.<New>
When I came here on a field
trip long ago, I thought
that their lives had
nothing to do with me...<New>
I never imagined I'd
be breaking in here
like this..."<Close><End of Block>

better than I do."<Close><End of Block>

the others were able
to sneak in safely?"<Close><End of Block>
