I'm not gonna kill you.<Delay 30>
All I want is for you to

"I told you that in my
intercom transmission
earlier.<New>
You're the one who
refused to listen to
me, right?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:54 h:4>
"Hah, ha, ha. Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I remember you were
saying something like that.<New>
I went off half-cocked and
thought you were the enemy.<New>
Uhh, ahem...
My name is Bart.
I'm the pirate that works
this territory."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"My name is Fei.<New>
I was arrested for no
apparent reason, shoved
into that Av transport
ship...<New>
...And was nearly going to
be sent to a concentration
camp until you went and
blew the thing to blazes.<New>
Anyway...
I'm just glad to have
been able to survive."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"I see...
Well, I'm glad I at least
helped you out a little.<New>
But I didn't expect a
civilian like you would
be riding in a military
Gear.<New>
Besides, this Gear is a
brand new model.
I've never seen this type
before."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:40 h:4>

"Where are we anyway?
Looks like we fell into
one weird place.<New>
I've never heard of huge

this existing under the
desert before."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"What? You don't know
anything, do you?<Delay 30>
Where are you from?<New>
The desert only covers
around 1000 sharls of the
outer layer of the earth.<New>
The stratum underneath
that consists of igneous
rock."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:46 h:4>

"From a sea of trees to

a stalactite cave...<New>

Never mind..."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"We're in trouble...<Delay 30>
Look, the hole we fell
through has disappeared.<New>
We'd better find some
other way out...<Delay 30>
So, you wanna call a
truce for now?<New>
...At least until we
find an exit and get
out of here."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:46 h:3>
Fei
"Yes...
agreed.<New>
First, we gotta find
the way out of here...
So, let's get going..."<Close><Close><End of Block>
