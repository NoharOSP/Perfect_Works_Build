Pirate
"Ha ha haaa. Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I remember you were
saying something like that.<New>
I went off half-cocked and
thought you were the enemy.<New>
Uhh, ahem...
My name is Bart.
I'm a pirate who works
this territory."<Close><End of Block>

For no apparent reason,
I was shoved onto that

Then the strife just now.<New>
Well, I'm rescued
at any rate."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"I see...
Well, I'm glad I at least
helped you out a little.<New>
But I didn't expect a
civilian like you would
be riding in a military
Gear.<New>
Besides, this Gear is a
brand-new model.
I've never seen this type
before."<Close><End of Block>

are you from?<New>
The desert only makes up

earth.<New>
The stratum underneath is
igneous rock like this."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"We're in trouble...<Delay 30>
Look, the hole we fell
through has disappeared.<New>
We'd better find some
other way out...<Delay 30>
So, you wanna call a
truce for now?<New>
...At least until we
find an exit and get
out of here?"<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"Yes...
agreed.<New>
First, we gotta find
the way out of here...
So, let's get going..."<Close><Close><End of Block>
