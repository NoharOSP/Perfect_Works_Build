<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:4>
This is <Stier>.
It's the Battling Champ,
Rico's Gear.<New>
Height 19 sharls
Base Weight 20.8 kahnns
Full Weight 27.5 kahnns<New>
Although it appears slow,
it's actually quite nimble
with the Grind-rollers.<New>
Since it's built for
Battling, it's got the
best endurance.<New>
The Drillclaw on the left
arm has the ability to tear
through steel plates of up
to 0.8 sharls.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:60 h:4>
This is <Stier-2>.
It is Rico's Gear.<New>
Height 19.2 sharls
Base Weight 22.2 kahnns
Full Weight 26.7 kahnns<New>
Like the other Omnigears,
it was at one point an Anima
Relic absorbed by Deus and
deactivated...<New>
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar
and Mechior, reconstructed it.<New>
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.<New>
Its standard weapon is the
same as it was before its
reconstruction.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:52 h:4>
This is <Vierge>.
It's the Gear for that
girl from Solaris.<New>
Height 15.7 sharls
Base Weight 10.2 kahnns
Full Weight 14.7 kahnns<New>
The frame along with the
armor have been minimized
for reduced weight.<New>
But within all that lies
the impressive technology
of Solaris.<New>
It's a lot more resistant
to damage than what its
appearance suggests.<New>
Rather than physical
damage, it's more
specialized for Ether
attacks.<New>
This is especially so with
the tail stabilizers and
equipped side skirts which
are used...<New>
...for the explosively
damaging Ether guidance
weapons, 'Aerods'.<New>
It basically reflects
that young lady's Ether
power directly.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:46 h:3>
<Renmazuo>
It is Billy's Gear.<New>
Height 15.9 sharls
Base Weight 11.6 kahnns
Full Weight 16.1 kahnns<New>
It's still under
investigation so I
don't know the details.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:52 h:5>
<Renmazuo>
This is Billy's Gear.<New>
Height 15.9 sharl
Base Weight 11.6 kahnns
Full Weight 16.1 kahnns<New>
Although on the outside
it looks like an 'Ethos'
-type Gear, inside, it
is entirely Solaris-type.<New>
Since it's for Etone use,
that Stone character most
likely brought it here
directly after its
creation in Solaris.<New>
But, because of that,
its capabilities are
really impressive.<New>
Especially those anti-Wels
Revolver Cannons equipped
in both arms.
They are very destructive.<New>
An average Gear would be
junk after taking one hit.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:60 h:4>
<Renmazuo2>
This is Billy's Gear.<New>
Height 18.8 sharl
Base Weight 14.9 kahnns
Full Weight 19.3 kahnns<New>
Like the other Omnigears it
was at one point an Anima
Relic that was absorbed by
Deus and thus deactivated.<New>
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar and
Mechior could reconstruct it.<New>
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.<New>
The standard weapon is the
same as before reconstruction.
Billy's father's Buntline
Cannon can still be used too.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:54 h:5>
<Crescens>
It's Emeralda's Gear.<New>
Height 15.4 sharl
Base Weight 9.7 kahnns
Full Weight 13.3 kahnns<New>
This Gear's controls are
quite unique.<New>
The colony of nanomachines
from Emeralda's body
physically merges with the
Gear for direct control.<New>
Theoretically, this Gear
shouldn't require repairs
but it seems they don't try
to repair anything except
Emeralda herself.<New>
So, we're left with no
other choice but to have
to maintain the Gear.<New>
The surface hovering and
flight capabilties are
quite impressive.<Close><End of Block>
