Where...<Delay 30>
am I?<New>
<Delay 30>Who...<Delay 30>
am I?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:20 h:2>
Is this...<Delay 30>
my memory?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:28 h:2>
Everyone...<Delay 30>
My...<Delay 20>memories?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:10 h:1>
Elly?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:14 h:1>
Mother?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:24 h:1>
Who are you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:32 h:3>
I'm surprised.
That was pretty
clever of you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:20 h:2>
You...<Delay 10>
Id?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:50 h:5>
I underestimated you
a bit.<Delay 10> I'd never have
thought that you, a mock
personality, could create
a fourth persona.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:34 h:1>
A fourth persona?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:50 h:4>
He doesn't feel anything.
He's shut himself away in
the shell of the ego.<New>
The facts that overwhelm
you and the truths you
don't want to face.<New>
Fearing those things,
you desired complete
seclusion from the
outside world.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:42 h:4>
And so you made up a
fourth personality.
A fourth Fei persona.<New>
His name...
doesn't matter.<New>
He's the one on
the stage now.
He's the one in
control of our body.<New>
But this, too, is a
futile resistance.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:26 h:1>
Come with me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:22 h:3>
Wait,
what are
you doing!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:34 h:4>
The key is in
his possession.
I just want him
to let me use it.<New>
There's somewhere
I have to go.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:22 h:2>
Are you...
coming too?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:32 h:2>
This is as far
as you can come.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:50 h:2>
From here on is my world.
You can't enter.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:34 h:1>
What do you mean?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:42 h:3>
You're a subordinate,
fake persona...
that's why.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:26 h:2>
A subordinate
fake persona?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:52 h:4>
Yes<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
He has part of my
memories from back then<Delay 5>...<New>
He has sealed away
the very meaning of
my existence<Delay 5>...<New>
my drive<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
my motivation<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
my subconscious<Delay 5> Id.<New>
Because of that,
I became a basic,
blank persona.<New>
And on top of that, I
constructed a new persona
based on my experiences
since then...<New>
That is what you are now!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:32 h:2>
Him? 
You mean Father?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:40 h:2>
You call him Father?<New>
He who never did
anything for you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:42 h:2>
It was because of his
cowardly behavior<Delay 5>...<New>
If only he had been
able to protect me<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:56 h:2>
If he had done that<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Mother wouldn't have died<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:2>
Didn't my mother die
right after I was born?<New>
What really happened to
my mother?<Delay 5> Tell me Id!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:54 h:2>
You don't need to know.
You'll only disappear soon.<New>
Along with your basic
persona, the 'coward'.<New>
I'll rule my being through
the power of the Existence.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:4 h:2>
 
??<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:54 h:3>
Of course you don't know.
But it is etched in my
metempsychotic memory.<New>
Your persona is fake, so
you'll never stand on the
'stage' of consciousness.<New>
You'll never be able to
take charge of the memories
from our past lives.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:42 h:3>
I know the dreams and
hallucinations! I've
seen them many times!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:38 h:4>
Them<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
I showed them to
you on purpose.<New>
To break the seal,
I chose to weaken
the power of your
existence.<New>
If your mental
energy is weakened,<Delay 5>
I can become free
to do as I wish.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:30 h:1>
What?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:50 h:3>
There are still things
inside you which you
haven't been shown yet<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:8 h:1>
Huh?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:54 h:3>
Someone's coming!
It's probably your friends.
They must have followed me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:40 h:1>
Where are you going?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:48 h:4>
I came to reestablish
contact with the
Existence.<New>
To tie together all the
threads of your memories
since ancient times<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
and then cut them off<Delay 5>...<New>
That is the fate of the
Contact<Delay 5>...<Delay 15> All is ready.
It's time for the true
awakening!<New>
I will eliminate all
those who were full of
hypocrisy from the very
beginning.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:32 h:2>
Wait!
Wait for me, Id!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:54 h:2>
          You just stay
<Opcode 1 255>          <Opcode 14 0>here and observe!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:54 h:3>
Yes<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
This is inside Id.<New>
A world filled with
hatred and sadness.<New>
That's all that's here<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Yes<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Now I understand, Id.<New>
Why you hate the world.<New>
Why there is nothing
inside you<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Nothing<Delay 5>...<New>
Nothing was given to you<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Deprived of<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
all the happy memories<Delay 5>...<New>
And yet<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
It feels pleasant<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
It almost feels good<Delay 5>...<New>
Now I get it<Delay 5>...!<Delay 10>
There's no need to resist.<New>
I was originally just an
existence that was created
as a cover to hide Id.<New>
So it would be better to
return to that place<Delay 5>...<New>
Let's come together<Delay 5>...<New>
To wipe away
everything<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Including ourselves<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
