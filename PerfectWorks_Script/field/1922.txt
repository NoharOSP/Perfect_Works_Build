Where...<Delay 30>
am I?<New>
<Delay 30>Who...<Delay 30>
am I?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:20 h:2>
Is this...<Delay 30>
my memory?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:28 h:2>
Everyone...<Delay 30>
My...<Delay 20>memories?<Close><End of Block>

Elly?<Close><End of Block>

Mother?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:24 h:1>
Who are you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:32 h:3>
I'm surprised.
That was pretty
clever of you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:20 h:2>
You...<Delay 10>
Id?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:50 h:5>
I underestimated you
a bit.<Delay 10> I'd never have
thought that you, a mock
personality, could create
a fourth persona.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:34 h:1>
A fourth persona?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:50 h:4>
He doesn't feel anything.
He's shut himself away in
the shell of the ego.<New>
The facts that overwhelm
you and the truths you
don't want to face.<New>
Fearing those things,
you desired complete
seclusion from the
outside world.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:42 h:4>
And so you made up a
fourth personality.
A fourth Fei persona.<New>
His name...
doesn't matter.<New>
He's the one on
the stage now.
He's the one in
control of our body.<New>
But this, too, is a
futile resistance.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:26 h:1>
Come with me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:22 h:3>
Wait,
what are
you doing!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:34 h:4>
The key is in
his possession.
I just want him
to let me use it.<New>
There's somewhere
I have to go.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:22 h:2>
Are you...
coming too?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:32 h:2>
This is as far
as you can come.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:50 h:2>
From here on is my world.<Delay 5>
You can't enter.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:16 h:1>
Why not?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:46 h:3>
Because you're a lower-
order, mock persona,<Delay 5>
subordinate to me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:28 h:2>
A lower-order,
mock persona?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:54 h:4>
That's right.<Delay 10>
...That day, he sealed
away a part of my memory<Delay 5>...<New>
The very 'id' that is
my reason for being.<New>
Because he sealed that
away, my base personality
was reinitialized.<New>
And the personality on
top of that, newly formed
from the experiences since
then...<New>
That is what you are now.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:42 h:3>
He!?<Delay 10>
Is that Father you're
talking about?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:40 h:2>
You call him Father?<New>
He who did nothing
for me?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:42 h:2>
It was because of his
incompetence that<--><New>
If only he'd been
able to protect me<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:54 h:2>
Then<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Mother needn't have died<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:2>
Didn't Mom die right
after I was born!?<New>
What really happened to
Mom!?<Delay 5> Tell me, Id!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:58 h:3>
You don't need to know.<Delay 5>
It's time for you to
disappear anyway.<New>
Along with that 'coward' who
is your base personality.<New>
I'll rule myself through
the power of 'the Existence'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:4 h:2>
 
??<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:52 h:4>
Of course you would have
no idea.<Delay 5> For that is
something etched in my
own metempsychotic memory.<New>
Being a mock personality,
you can't ascend to the
'stage' where memories
are managed.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:40 h:3>
I do know about the
dreams and the
phantom memories.<New>
I've seen such
things many times!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:46 h:4>
Those are the ones
I showed to you
intentionally.<New>
In order to lift the
seal, I opted to weaken
your power as an entity
unto yourself.<New>
When your mental
energy is weakened,
I can act freely.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:32 h:1>
What!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:44 h:3>
Naturally, there was
more within me besides
what I showed you<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:8 h:1>
Huh?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:54 h:3>
Looks like someone's here.<Delay 5>
It's probably your friends.
They must've followed me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:42 h:1>
Where are you going!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:54 h:4>
I came here to make
contact with the
Existence once again.<New>
To become the one who ties
together all the threads of
memory that have endured
since ancient times,<New>
and then severs them...<Delay 10>
That is the destiny of
the Contact.<New>
The preparations have
been made.<Delay 5> It's time for
the true awakening.<New>
The first thing I'll do
is have those who are full
of hypocrisy annihilated.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:32 h:2>
Wait!
Wait for me, Id!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:54 h:2>
         You just stay
<Opcode 1 255>         <Opcode 14 0>there and observe.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:56 h:3>
I see<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
This is inside Id.<New>
A world filled with
hatred and sadness.<New>
That's all there is<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Yes<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Now I understand, Id.<New>
Why you hate the world...<New>
For you there was nothing<Delay 5>...<New>
Nothing<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
All the happy memories are<--><New>
And yet<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
it feels somehow alright<Delay 5>...<New>
It feels good<Delay 5>...<New>
That's right<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
I don't need to fight it.<New>
All I've ever been is an
existence to conceal Id.<New>
So we should return
to that place<Delay 5>...<New>
Let's stay together<Delay 5>...<New>
Erase everything<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
including ourselves<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
