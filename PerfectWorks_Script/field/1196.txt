It's enough work just

Aww man!<Delay 10> The levitron's
coil is also burnt...<Opcode 2 30><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:48 h:4>
The coil'll break if the
toroid is cooled down
suddenly...<Delay 60> It's big,
but it's delicate...<Opcode 2 60><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:40 h:2>
The electric circuit
is optimized and...<Opcode 2 30><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:42 h:4>
The levitron's not in
a good mood today.<Delay 10>
The plasma cools down
too quickly...<Opcode 2 60><Close><End of Block>

Is the fuse alright?<Opcode 2 30><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:48 h:5>
It's almost time<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
We may not be able to do
much on the front line,
but we'll give you the
best support we can!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:40 h:4>
There's a new gadget
in the aft...!<New>
I'm lucky to be able
to work on something
that awesome at my
age... <Delay 10>Hehehe.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:34 h:2>
Don't worry.
It's going great!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:32 h:3>
You're going to
some ghost ship?<Delay 10>
Be careful, now!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:30 h:4>
Elly
"Chief...
I'm very sorry.<Delay 10>
I..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:50 h:3>
That's alright.<Delay 10>
Everybody makes mistakes.<New>
I don't find it a problem
with young people making
mistakes!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:56 h:2>
(But, if you do it again,
you're gonna be in deep...!)<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:4>
I've been working on
these engines for many
long years...<New>
But I can't figure out
why high energy plasma
is produced in the
Slave Generators...<New>
Actually nobody knows the
generators' mechanism of
either ships or Gears.<New>
But perhaps that Solaris
may know what Slave
Generators really are...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:52 h:3>
Good, good!!<Delay 10> It's better
than before, since we can
now use water for cooling.<New>
But because of that,
there's more labor needed.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:50 h:3>
Young Master<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>doesn't
this place remind you of
the day of that accident?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:52 h:3>
Well the Yggdrasil sank...<Delay 10>
But fortunately we were
able to find this one...<New>
But whenever I work on
this engine I get this
mysterious feeling...<New>
Like this ship is somehow
'related' to the previous
one...<Delay 10> Strange, huh!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:48 h:3>
You failed...<Delay 10>
Well, everyone has their
ups and downs in life.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:52 h:3>
Young Master, forget about
the past... What's more
important is the future.<New>
Today's battle isn't over
yet.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:46 h:4>
A mechanic's greatest
moment is the night
before a mission!<New>
Tomorrow is that once
in a life time day when
this ship can show what
it's really made of...<New>
I'm gonna make you
beautiful, old girl!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
Marguerite has returned

time to settle the score.<New>
Engine!<Delay 5> I'm counting on
you!<Delay 10> When it's over, you
and I can have plenty of
rest...<Delay 10> Good rest...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:44 h:3>
Good job!<Delay 10>
We saved Marguerite!<New>
I hear some guy called
Fei, a martial artist,
helped us out there.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:46 h:4>
Y, you, quit loafing
around here and go
concentrate on training
like that guy Fei!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:46 h:3>
Here we go!
This time you're going
to save Marguerite!<New>
I gave you enough fuel
...so let's go get her!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:50 h:3>
Phew, finally I can let
her rest. Take plenty of
rest while you still can!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:52 h:3>
Nobody touches the machine
here except myself.
Even the young master!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:44 h:1>
Uhh... Young Master...<Close><End of Block>

Whoa whoa!!

Engine Full Power!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:52 h:4>
Guys from Shevat installed
tons of stuff for me...<Delay 10>
so it's much more fun to
work on!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:28 h:1>
See you later!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:60 h:3>
...<Delay 10>
You're alright, aren't you?<Delay 10>
You're the normal Elly, right?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:3>
Awh shoot!!<Delay 10>
I must restore it again
because of that girl!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:56 h:3>
Phew...
It's somehow moving alright.
Now, I've got to restore it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:52 h:3>
Young Master<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>do you
think the sunken Yggdrasil
is resting in peace now?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:54 h:3>
I wonder if the engine of
our old sunken Yggdrasil is
weeping in the deep sand...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:48 h:4>
No, she's resting there.
We ought to believe it
must be the best place
for her,<Delay 10> otherwise...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:60 h:3>
This Yggdrasil is still here.<Delay 10>
As long as it's in good shape,
we can do many more rematches!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:44 h:4>
That old man is all
fired up with zeal...<Delay 10>
I sure hope his blood
vessels don't burst...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:44 h:4>
No need to worry!<Delay 10>
His blood vessels are
made of duralumin and
oil flows inside them.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:40 h:2>
Finally, the engine 
can take a rest.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:58 h:3>
When we get to Nisan, we can
give the engine a rest again.<New>
See the big donut shape
running along the six poles
standing underneath here?<New>
The plasma generated inside
there is the power source
for the ship.<New>
The same goes for the Gears.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:34 h:2>
The old man's in
a good old mood!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:38 h:2>
You shouldn't go up
there. Trust me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:50 h:3>
He's always like that.
Don't take it personally.
He's not a bad person.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:50 h:3>
Once again, final checks!<Delay 10>
Every second counts!<Delay 5>
The young master forever!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:54 h:3>
When we had engine trouble
a long time ago, the young
master jumped in to fix it.<New>
Sigurd tried to help the
young master and they both
ended up injuring one eye.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:52 h:3>
We are proud of the young
master, but<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>he sometimes
rushes into things.<New>
The chief thinks it's
all his own fault.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:48 h:2>
The chief has a weakness
for young women.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:54 h:3>
W, what! It's expected for
a man to be kind to women, 
isn't it!?<Close><End of Block>

(Grrr!!<Delay 5>
But you're cold to
your own wife!!)<Close><End of Block>

Engine Full Power!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:58 h:3>
I asked the guys from Shevat
about it...<Delay 10> But it sounds
like they don't even know.<New>
They told me nobody knows how
their country flies anymore.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:56 h:3>
A machine that's kept moving
since ancient times, without
any maintenance, eh...<New>
I must uncover the secret of
its mechanism.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:22 h:1>
Be careful!<Close><End of Block>

Please don't break
it this time.<Close><End of Block>

How could he figure out
this complicated device
so easily...?<New>
Generally, more than a
specified output can't
be produced.<New>
What kind of hypnosis
was he under?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:44 h:3>
The Tamuz sounds like
a fun place to visit.<Delay 10>
I'm gonna sneak out...<Close><End of Block>

What the hell are you
sneaking out for!?<Delay 10> Wait
till you're independent!<Close><End of Block>

She'll carry on the

Sorry, but I really don't
want to talk about it.<Delay 10>
Please leave me alone...<Close><End of Block>

Oh, Young Master, you're
alright!<Delay 10> What's your plan
from now on?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 66 w:40 h:3>
Shoot!<Delay 10> I found a bug
at a time like this!
What should I do<Delay 5>...<New>
I wonder if I'll be
able to fix it by
tomorrow...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 67 w:42 h:1>
It's falling apart...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 68 w:46 h:2>
We're almost at Nisan!!<Delay 10>
Come on, engine!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 69 w:52 h:1>
Engine's doing fantastic!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 70 w:52 h:2>
You shouldn't go up there.<Close>
Trust me!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 71 w:56 h:4>
He yelled at you, didn't he?
He gets mad at us, too.
He only opens his heart to
his dog, Myrtle.<Close><End of Block>
