This old man will follow
you to the pits of hell!"<Close><End of Block>

Engineer
"The main engine and effect-
fins' oscillators are mostly
unharmed...<New>
...but the electrical
connections between them
are wasted.<New>
We are bypassing the main
connection and trying to
scrape together all the
energy we can.<New>
But it will only give us
70% of our usual maximum
power at best.<New>
The propulsion drills are
not damaged, but if the
sand can't be granulated
they might as well be.<New>
We'll make battle speed 3
...only barely."<Close><End of Block>

All personnel to battle

Bart
"Sig! Listen!<New>
Surrendering isn't going to
change Nisan's fate.<New>
We'd surely lose the
Yggdrasil, the core of our
power in saving Av and
Margie.<New>
No... Being a man of the
desert means betting on
hope, even if it's rash!"<Close><End of Block>

But they're forgetting one
thing...<Delay 10>
It's harder to bring in an
