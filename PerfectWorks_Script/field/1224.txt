It seems like<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>
we've drifted
further off.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:50 h:2>
<Delay 3>...<Delay 5>Constantly<Delay 5> drifting<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Sounds like me right now.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:34 h:1>
What do you mean?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:46 h:4>
In the end, maybe I've
just been <Delay 3>carried
along by circumstances
and acting aimlessly.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:36 h:4>
No<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>that's
not the case.<New>
In Av,<Delay 3> you helped
Bart when he
needed you.<New>
And in Kislev,<Delay 3>
you gave your all
to defend,<Delay 8> to
save everyone.<New>
You've even shown
concern<Delay 3> for me
many times.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:34 h:2>
No<Delay 3>...<Delay 8>
I'm <Delay 3>just no good.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:8 h:1>
Why?<Delay 3><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
I'm not sure if, deep
down, I really<Delay 8> want
to help.<New>
Somehow, I get the
feeling that all I've
done I did because I
wanted to be needed.<New>
Because if I did something
for them<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>then maybe
<Delay 3>I'd <Delay 3>have a place to
belong<Delay 3>...<New>
There's a side of me that
is comforted that way.<New>
Like I said back there in
Noatun, that's certainly
not zero.<New>
But it's not<Delay 5>
'one' either.<New>
While I was behaving this
way, drifting,<Delay 8> I met you,
Elly...<New>
and now we're stranded
out in the ocean.<New>
I'm sorry<Delay 3>...<Delay 8>I got
you involved.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:46 h:5>
It's okay.<Delay 3>
Don't worry about me.<New>
I've been thinking<Delay 3>
about why I'm here,
myself.<Delay 3><New>
I could've just
turned back.<Delay 3>
But for some reason<Delay 3>
I didn't...<New>
Probably because
you said it's better
to do something
rather than nothing.<New>
I think that's why
I felt I had to do
something too.<New>
It doesn't have
to be 'one'.<Delay 3><New>
Even if it's the
tiniest bit, when
you repeat that many
times over it becomes
'one',<Delay 8> right?<New>
That's<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>
not zero.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:30 h:2>
You're right<Delay 3>...<Delay 8>
I'm sorry<Delay 3>...<Close><End of Block>

"If we're saved...<Delay 10>
will you go back?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"I don't think I'll
rejoin my squad.<New>
Right now, I feel
strongly that I don't
want to be part of
that,<Delay 5> and...<New>
Besides,<Delay 3> I could probably
do something else...<Delay 5>
I don't have to be in the
army.<New>
So I think I'll go
back to my country."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:50 h:3>
Fei
"Will it be alright?
Y'know, with the army?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:48 h:3>
Elly
"It's not like anyone
knows what I did.<New>
They've probably already
classified me as MIA.
It'll be okay."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:30 h:4>
Fei
"I see.<New>
I hope you'll
be spared any
trouble, at
least.<New>
I'm sure you'll
find your
calling in
life!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:36 h:4>
Elly
"You said...
something about...
being<Delay 20> comforted."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:14 h:2>
Fei
"Yeah."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"Don't be too hard on
yourself.<Delay 5> It's like that
for everyone,<New>
giving to others something
from within ourselves
because we want the same
in return.<New>
...<Delay 10>It's like that
even for me.<New>
You forced yourself to
eat those rations for me
earlier, didn't you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:22 h:1>
UUUURRRGHH!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:42 h:2>
Elly
"Hey...<Delay 10>are you okay?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:44 h:4>
Elly
"I told you not to eat
such a gross looking
creature..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"It tastes horrible.<New>
The last time I had food
this bad it was Doc's
cooking..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:3 h:1>
?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:34 h:4>
Fei
"But unless we do
something, we're
really done for."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"I guess there's no other
way. I was hoping to save
this a little longer..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:54 h:3>
Elly
"This should hold us
for another day...<New>
But it's only for emergency
calories so I can't vouch
for the taste..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"Huh!?<Delay 10>
What?<Delay 10>
It's dry and crumbly?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:36 h:4>
Elly
"I thought so...
You don't like it,
do you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"Wha? N-No...<Delay 10>
It's good.
Yeah, ah, it's great.<New>
Anything you'd go to
the trouble of sharing
with me can't taste
that bad, can it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"You forced yourself to
eat those rations for me
earlier, didn't you?<New>
If I was considering only
my own survival, it would
have been better to keep
them for myself.<New>
But you know, watching you
doing your best to eat it,
I too felt comforted.<New>
I was glad that I had
shared them with you...
It made me feel a little
better."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:40 h:2>
Fei
"For your own sake?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes,<Delay 5> for my own sake.<Delay 10>
Selfish, I admit.<New>
But I think it's okay to
be like that at first.<New>
And if, little by little,
you learn the joy of
giving...<New>
I think someday it'll be
possible to share an
important part of yourself
for the sake of others.<New>
Surely...<Delay 20>someday."<Close><End of Block>

What's up?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Hmmm. Nothing. It just
felt as though I'd told you
the same thing long ago...<New>
It must be my imagination.
I couldn't have said it to
you before, because we've
only just met, haven't we?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:46 h:3>
Elly
"Yes, it's probably
just my imagination<Delay 10>..."<Close><End of Block>

Hey, Elly!
Wake up!"<Close><End of Block>
