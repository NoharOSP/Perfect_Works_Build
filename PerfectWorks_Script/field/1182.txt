I found out that the main
scientist central to the M
Plan moved the true facts
about it into a test-Gear.<New>
Then he let that test-Gear
escape with his daughter,<Delay 5>
so that the truth would
not be discovered...<New>
And that,<Delay 5> I'm afraid,<Delay 5> was
the last information that
I was able to obtain..."<Close><End of Block>

Jessie
"Because of what I found
out, I came down to the
surface world...<New>
And this is where I hid,
along with my wife,
Racquel, and son Billy.<New>
I've been looking for
that Gear and the girl
ever since."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 131 w:52 h:4>
Jessie
"Finally,<Delay 10> I found out that
the scientist's daughter
and Gear may be in Shevat.<New>
All very well, except now
I don't know how in blazes
to get there, or even how
to contact the place.<New>
Well, Shevat is protected
by a strong barrier that
even Solaris can't do
anything about...<New>
So I guess you can say
it can't be helped...<Delay 10>
It's just my luck!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 132 w:32 h:3>
That girl's name
wouldn't happen
to be Maria...?<Close><End of Block>

"Oh, are you two alright?<Delay 10>
Shouldn't you get some
more rest...?"<Close><End of Block>

"Yes, I can stand and
can even walk now...
Thank you."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 136 w:52 h:4>
Jessie
"Maria, eh...?<Delay 10> Hmm...<Delay 10>
If I remember right, her
father's name was Nikola?<New>
Hey! Fei wasn't it?
I hear from Hyuda you're
some gear prodigy. Is
that right?<New>
Well, I bet four eyes
never told all there
is to know about 
"Hyper Mode" huh?<New>
I knew it! I can tell
from that puzzled look!
Hyuga was always weak in 
the piloting department.<New>
Could always tell you how
they're made, but never how
to use 'em!<New> 
When you get comforable
fighting in the flesh, you
can take those techniques
and apply them to gears.<New>
This builds weapon levels
for the gears. They normally
go up to three.<New> 
But I bet you're already 
aware of this kid. But if
you sit on level 3, you have
a chance to reach even higher.<New>
That's Hyper Mode. You get
immense power at your fingers,
letting you rip 'em a new one
or charge fuel faster.<New>
But it doesn't last forever,
yet Billy seemed to last twice
as long as the average man when
I taught 'em.<New>
But it's normally a short burst
of power. No one really gets how
it happens though...<New>
People say it's desperation,
the will to live kickin in.<New>
If things are getting tough,
you might wanna try your luck
with it. Reckon it might just
save your life.<New>
Thank me? Ha! You can thank
me by not dying after I shared
my wisdom with the new generation!<New>
That, or the most expensive booze
you can buy! Ha ha ha ha!"<Close><End of Block>

"Hmm,<Delay 10> it's got to be them.<Delay 10>
So that huge Gear is in
Shevat then!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 139 w:52 h:4>
Jessie
"So then...<Delay 10> how can we get
to this Shevat? Is there a
way to contact the place?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 140 w:54 h:4>
Shevat Agent

taken captive I have no way
of contacting them either."<Close><End of Block>

Shevat Agent
"There just may be a way...!
Originally, Shevat was
situated on top of
Babel Tower.<New>
They say there is a
communication facility to
contact Shevat's native
country on top of the tower.<Delay 10> 
If only it still exists..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 144 w:44 h:4>

"Hmm...<New>
There is a good
possibility the
facility may have
been destroyed...<New>
Especially when you
consider the fact
that the tower was
sealed by the Church."<Close><End of Block>

"I guess we have no choice
but try and go there.<New>
As long as the gate exists,
we can't escape from

In other words, even if we
recover Av from Shakhan,
it wouldn't immediatley be
a happy ending."<Close><End of Block>

Either way, as long

"Their 'secret plan'
bothers me, too...<New>
The real secret is that
they are using humans
gathered from earth..."<Close><End of Block>

secret plan<Delay 5> and <Delay 5>the Church's

Solaris think us surface

"What my country's doing...<Delay 10>
has nothing to do with me.<New>
I myself thought something

So, don't worry about me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 154 w:58 h:4>
Fei
"We've got nothing to lose,
so let's try to go there.<New>
We need to find the truth
about those documents found
in the Church of the Ethos
HQ.<New>
and what Billy's father said.
And I must go to Shevat
too for my own personal
reasons anyway."<Close><End of Block>
