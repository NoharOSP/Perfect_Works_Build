ever since."<Close><End of Block>

"And so,<Delay 10> I heard that the
scientist's daughter and
the Gear may be in Shevat.<New>
All very well, except I
don't know how in blazes
to get to this Shevat, or
how to make contact.<New>
The place is protected by
a strong barrier that even
Solaris can't do anything
about, so...<New>
Just my luck..."<Close><End of Block>

If I remember right, her

Originally, Shevat was

They say there is a facility

At any rate, as long
