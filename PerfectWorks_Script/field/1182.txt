"When I was in Solaris,
I learned of the existence

That was the M,<Delay 5>

In order to proceed with
the plan, many Lambs were
gathered by the Church
to become guinea pigs.<New>
Or I should say, to
become Wels..."<Close><End of Block>

"Disgusted with Solaris'
methods, I decided to

I found out that a

the true facts about it<New>
into a prototype Gear,
and then had it escape
along with his daughter.<New>
But that,<Delay 5> I'm afraid,<Delay 5> was

ever since."<Close><End of Block>

the Gear may be in Shevat.<New>
All very well, except I
don't know how in blazes
to get to this Shevat, or
how to make contact.<New>
The place is protected by
a strong barrier that even
Solaris can't do anything

Just my luck..."<Close><End of Block>
