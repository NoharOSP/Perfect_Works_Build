"One weakness that I can see
from watching your bout is 
that you seem to use your

You should better understand
the nature of the attack...
'Ether Bullets' raise your
'Heat Gauge (H.G.)' by quite
a large percentage.<New>
Three shots will easily send
your H.G. to the MAX 
condition. If you continue

your machine overheats.<New>

Dashing about may be a good
strategy but you'll notice
that the 'Heat Gauge (H.G.)'
which shows your Gear's heat
level, climbs much faster!<New>
You can continue to DASH
even after your H.G. reaches
the MAX condition, but as 
your Gear overheats more and
more, it will cause damage!<Close>

Receptionist
"There are two reasons for
your loss. First, your over-
reliance on the 'R1 button'
to shoot 'Ether bullets'.<New>
'Ether Bullets' are useful
when your foe is far away,
but using them too much will
cause problems with your own
Gear's heat level!<New>
Second is your over-use of
'Dash movement'. The use of
either of these when your
'Heat Gauge' is at MAX will
cause your Gear to overheat!<New>

you will be taking damage,
so if you're not careful,
before you know it, your 
H.P. will fall to zero!"<Close><End of Block>
