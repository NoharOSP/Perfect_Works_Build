The invasion by Solaris'
Mobile Surface-Supremacy
Weapon was fierce,<Delay 5> and
Shevat and Nisan's standard
Gear battalions were no
match for it.<Delay 45>
 
It was only a matter of

headed for the Central
District in Noatun,<Delay 15> to
obtain our one and only
means of standing against

The Solaris mobile weapon

Peace was signed,

unearthly things.<Delay 10>
One after the other,
people were mutating
into abnormal forms.<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 9 w:60 h:11>
After that, we went from
place to place, destroying
all the Soylent System
installations on the surface

had been held in them.<Delay 15>
 
Nisan wholeheartedly took
in the people who had
mutated, and there they
received treatment.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:60 h:9>
Those in the less advanced

not as promising<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>

Keeping ther bodies just
barely human in appearance

However,<Delay 5> strangely,<Delay 5> they
no longer competed with
one another for survival
as they had when sheltered

Of course, their physical
agony had been remedied
by the treatment,<Delay 5> but it
wasn't only that<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
Most of those received by
Nisan were the very ones

admonished by Elly <--> had
realized how people were
originally meant to be.<Close><End of Block>

In between Soylent-destruction
activities, Elly went around

'Go to Nisan and you will

The news spread, and
people from all over
gathered in Nisan
seeking physical and
spiritual aid.<New>
 
Freed from the supervision
of Solaris, the surface
dwellers were assembling
in one place.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:56 h:11>
Although the land dwellers
fell into momentary chaos
due to being free of the
Limiters, somehow they began

We decided to search for
the remaining Vessels of
Anima<Delay 5> <--> <Delay 5>objects that were

In the past, ten Vessels

Around half of those were

<TextBlock 17 w:58 h:11>
According to Zephyr,<Delay 5> there
were still supposed to be a

on the surface.<Delay 30>
 
It was a fact that Solaris
was investigating them.<Delay 30>
 
There was no way we could
let Solaris have them.<New>
We visited a place where,<Delay 5>
at one time,<Delay 5> some old records
had led Zephyr and her allies
to discover a Vessel.<Delay 10>
 
Following the information
we obtained from there,<Delay 5> we
headed for a location that
seemed to be<Delay 5> the ruins of
an ancient civilization.<Close><End of Block>

Having dealt with the Elements,
who had been after a Vessel to
use as an instrument of Ramsus'
vision,<Delay 15> once again we set

another place of interest...<Delay 30>
in search of the final Vessel.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:60 h:9>
Having completed the alignment
of the first Vessel of Anima
with Billy, there was a
remarkable change in the
appearance and structure
of Billy's Gear.<New>
They were units that merged
with the inorganic<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
Of course we had no idea what
purpose these ancient Vessels
of Anima were created for.<Delay 5>
But the fact that they played
some kind of role as weapons
was blatantly obvious.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:54 h:12>
Eventually their true
power will be released<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
And we cannot allow this
power to fall into the
hands of evil.<Delay 30>
 
In order to obtain the
final Vessel,<Delay 5> we headed for
a ruin that is believed to
be almost 10,000 years old.<Delay 5>
...<Delay 5>The remains of the first
civilization on our planet.<Close><End of Block>

a reunion with an old

'His brief moment of power'<Delay 5>...<New>
Hammer's smile<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
Was that the look of joy from

Or was it the look of relief
from the pain that was brought
upon him by his mutation<Delay 5>...?<Close><End of Block>

Ultimately,<Delay 5> we had no other
choice but to defeat our<Delay 5>

Was there any other way

Elly cried continuously<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
She hated herself for not

I couldn't help thinking<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
I can no longer allow her
