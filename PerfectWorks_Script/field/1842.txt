The invasion by Solaris'
Mobile Surface-Supremacy
Weapon was fierce,<Delay 5> and
Shevat and Nisan's standard
Gear battalions were no
match for it.<Delay 45>
 
It was only a matter of
time before the Solaris
mobile weapon reached
Nisan.<New>
 
While fending off the
Solarian Gear units, we
headed for the Central
District in Noatun,<Delay 15> to
obtain our one and only
means of standing against
the mobile weapon.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:54 h:9>
The Solaris mobile weapon
was destroyed<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>

Peace was signed,
and after 500 years
the land of Ignis was
united once again.<Close><End of Block>

Excitement spread throughout

The sky shimmered as if

Soon, the songs of victory

<TextBlock 6 w:50 h:7>
At first we had no idea
what had transpired.<Delay 10>
We witnessed<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
unearthly things.<Delay 10>
One after the other,
people were mutating
into abnormal forms.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:56 h:8>
A situation that triggered

were undone by the

His words were<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
  'An "ordinary" guy

<TextBlock 9 w:60 h:11>
After that, we went from
place to place, destroying
all the Soylent System
installations on the surface
and freeing the people who
had been held in them.<Delay 15>
 
Nisan wholeheartedly took
in the people who had
mutated, and there they
received treatment.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:60 h:9>
Those in the less advanced
stages were able to have their
anatomies restored by Torah's

their original form.<Delay 20>
 
But for the more heavily
afflicted, the results were
not as promising<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:52 h:10>
Keeping their bodies just
barely human in appearance
was the best that could
be done.<Delay 45>
 
However,<Delay 5> strangely,<Delay 5> they
no longer competed with
one another for survival
as they had when sheltered
at the Soylent System.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:56 h:11>
Of course, their physical
agony had been remedied
by the treatment,<Delay 5> but it
wasn't only that<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
Most of those received by
Nisan were the very ones
who <--> having been
admonished by Elly <--> had
realized how people were
originally meant to be.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:60 h:9>
In between Soylent-destruction
activities, Elly went around
nursing the people sheltered
in Nisan.<Delay 30>
 
She tended to the bodies that

the people who had no one else
to turn to<Delay 5>...<Delay 5><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:60 h:9>
Seeing her like that, Elly was
the very image of the woman

In whispers, it became rumored

of this Sophia.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:52 h:8>
'Go to Nisan and you will
receive salvation<Delay 5>...'<Delay 30>
 
The news spread, and
people from all over
gathered in Nisan
seeking physical and
spiritual aid.<New>
 
Freed from the supervision
of Solaris, the surface
dwellers were assembling
in one place.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:56 h:11>
Although the land dwellers
fell into momentary chaos
due to being free of the
Limiters, somehow they began
to recover a state of calm.<New>
We decided to search for
the remaining Vessels of
Anima<Delay 5> <--> <Delay 5>objects that were
to be elementary parts of
the Omnigears.<Delay 30>
 
In the past, ten Vessels
had been discovered<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
Around half of those were
said to be in the hands
of the Ministry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:58 h:11>
According to Zephyr,<Delay 5> there
were still supposed to be a
few Vessels lying in wait
on the surface.<Delay 30>
 
It was a fact that Solaris
was investigating them.<Delay 30>
 
There was no way we could
let Solaris have them.<New>
We visited a place where,<Delay 5>
at one time,<Delay 5> some old records
had led Zephyr and her allies
to discover a Vessel.<Delay 10>
 
Following the information
we obtained from there,<Delay 5> we
headed for a location that
seemed to be<Delay 5> the ruins of
an ancient civilization.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:62 h:10>
Having dealt with the Elements,
who had been after a Vessel to
use as an instrument of Ramsus'
vision,<Delay 15> once again we set
about obtaining information on
another place of interest...<Delay 30>
in search of the final Vessel.<Close><End of Block>

The first Vessel of Anima
performed its alignment with
Billy, making the form of
the Gear he piloted change
significantly.<New>
   Units that fused with
   inanimate matter<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
For what purpose the Vessels
of Anima had been created in
ancient times, we still didn't
know,<Delay 5> but it could easily be
imagined that they had some
role as weapons.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:54 h:12>
Sooner or later, that true
power would be unleashed<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
We could not allow it to
fall into their hands.<Delay 30>
 
In order to obtain the
final Vessel,<Delay 5> we headed
for the ruins of a
primitive people,<Delay 5>
believed to have been built
almost 10,000 years ago.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:44 h:5>
And<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
There, a reunion
with an 'old friend'
awaited us<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>

Hammer disappeared into

His smile<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>

Or was it the peace of
being released from the
agony caused by his
alteration<Delay 5>...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:58 h:9>
In the end,<Delay 5> we had no
choice but to take down our
comrade, Hammer,<Delay 5> for the
sake of our own survival<Delay 5>...<Delay 45>
 
Wasn't there another way<Delay 5>...?<Delay 15>
I'd never felt fighting

<TextBlock 24 w:56 h:9>
Elly couldn't stop crying<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
She cried in regret over
her own lack of power to
do anything to help.<Delay 30>
 
Seeing Elly like that,
I thought to myself<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
That I couldn't let her

With these unbearable

and then storm inside it<Delay 5>...<Delay 45>
 
We initiated the operation

At that time, the earth
quaked and shook.<Delay 15> And,<Delay 5>
from the location where
the Merkabah crashed,<Delay 15> a
giant object appeared.<New>
 
It was Deus' final form.<Delay 45>
 
The Merkabah was merely
its vessel.<Delay 15>
Deus evolved through
the use of Karellen's
nanomachines into a
planetary scale weapon
and began terraforming.<Close><End of Block>

It was attempting to
convert this entire
planet into a weapon...

We decided to go back into
Deus. Time was running out
