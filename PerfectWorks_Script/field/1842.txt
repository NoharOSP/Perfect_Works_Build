Solaris' 'Mobile Surface
Supremacy Weapon' invaded

Shevat and Nisan's standard
Gear battalions were no

It was only a matter of

Mobile Weapon arrived in
Nisan.<New>
After we pushed back the
Solarian Gear units, we
headed for Noatun<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
to the Kislev capital's
administrative district.<Delay 15>
 
We went there to obtain
our one and only means

the Mobile Weapon.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:54 h:9>
The Solaris Mobile Weapon
was destroyed<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>which

Peace was signed and after
some 500 years of division,
the land of Ignas once

<TextBlock 6 w:54 h:7>
In the beginning we had no

We<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>witnessed inexplicable

People from all parts of

into abnormal forms.<Close><End of Block>

removed the Limiter seal
that was placed on humankind

innate abilities released.<Close><End of Block>

After that, we went from place
to place, destroying all the
Soylent System facilities
located on the surface of the
earth and freed the people
held at each of the locations.<Delay 15>
 
All the people that had been
mutated were taken in by Nisan
where they received treatment.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:60 h:9>
Those who had mutated only
mildly were treated with
Torah's nanomachines,
which reconstructed and
revived them.
 
They were able to return

bodies.<New>
 
Unfortunately, there were some

symptoms that their treatment
was not as promising<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>

Trying to bring them back

a human was the best that

However,<Delay 5> mysteriously,
they no longer fought each
other for survival as they
did when they were held by
the Soylent System.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:56 h:11>
Of course, their recovery
from the physical pain of
the mutation may have
played a factor,<Delay 5> but it
wasn't only that<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
The majority of the people
received by Nisan were those
that had been admonished by
Elly and had regained their
humanity.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:60 h:9>
Between her work in destroying
the Soylent System facilities,
Elly also went around and
nursed the people in Nisan.<Delay 30>
 
She aided the bodies of the
mutated and lent an ear to
those who had no other place
to go for help<Delay 5>...<Delay 5><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:58 h:8>
She was the very image of the
woman who created Nisan<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
 
  'Mother Sophia'<Delay 5>...<Delay 45>
 
It became rumored that<Delay 5> Elly
was a reincarnation or a
second advent of Sophia.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:8>
Go to Nisan and you will
receive salvation<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
The news<Delay 5> seemed to spread
further about and people
came from all over to be
saved, both physically
and spiritually.<New>
 
Free from the supervision
of Solaris, the surface
dwellers began to unite
in one place.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:56 h:10>
Although the initial impact
of being released from the
Limiter seal caused some
momentary chaos, everything
slowly began to settle down.<New>
We then began to search for
the Anima Vessels<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
the catalyst to transform
Gears into Omnigears.<Delay 30>
 
In the past, ten Vessels had
been recovered<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
It is said that about half
of those are in the hands
of the Ministry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:58 h:11>
According to Zephyr,<Delay 5> there
should be several more
Vessels hidden in the land.<Delay 30>
 
We knew then that Solaris
would most certainly be
searching for them.<Delay 5>
 
There was no way we could
allow Solaris to have them.<New>
We visited the place where,<Delay 5>
using archaic records,<Delay 5> Zephyr
and her people had been able
to get clues on the where-
abouts of the Vessels.<Delay 10>
 
Following the information
we obtained from there,<Delay 5> we
headed towards the ruins of<Delay 5>
what seemed to be<Delay 5> an ancient
civilization.<Close><End of Block>

Having fled from the Elements,

be used as a power to fulfill
Ramsus' desires...<Delay 15>
 
we once again intiated our

on the whereabouts of the
last known Vessel<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:60 h:9>
Having completed the alignment
of the first Anima Vessel with
Billy, there was a remarkable
change in the appearance and
structure of Billy's Gear.<New>
They were units that merged
with the inorganic<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
 
Of course we had no idea what
purpose these ancient Anima
Vessels were created for.<Delay 5>
But the fact that they played
some kind of role as weapons
was blatantly obvious.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:54 h:12>
Eventually their true
power will be released<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
And we cannot allow this
power to fall into the
hands of evil.<Delay 30>
 
In order to obtain the
final Vessel,<Delay 5> we headed for
a ruin that is believed to
be almost 10,000 years old.<Delay 5>
...<Delay 5>The remains of the first
civilization on our planet.<Close><End of Block>

a reunion with an old

been able to attain it<Delay 5>...?<Delay 15>
'His brief moment of power'<Delay 5>...<New>
Hammer's smile<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
Was that the look of joy from
attaining power<Delay 5>...?<Delay 15>
Or was it the look of relief
from the pain that was brought
upon him by his mutation<Delay 5>...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:58 h:9>
Ultimately,<Delay 5> we had no other
choice but to defeat our<Delay 5>

Was there any other way
around it<Delay 5>...?<Delay 15>
I've never felt that fighting
was so futile, until now<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>

Elly cried continuously<Delay 5>...<Delay 30>
She hated herself for not
having the power to be able

When I saw her like that,
I couldn't help thinking<Delay 5>...<Delay 15>
I can no longer allow her

and then storm inside it<Delay 5>...<Delay 45>
 
We initiated the operation
