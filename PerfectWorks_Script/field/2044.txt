<TextBlock 1 w:30 h:1>
Where am I...!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:42 h:3>
That's Elly!
This must mean that
I am inside of Deus!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:56 h:6>
Not exactly.<New>
Your real body is still 
physical...<Delay 5> It has
merely been absorbed into
Deus' outer-shell.<Delay 5>
Only your consciousness is
here.<New>
Of course, the girl you 
perceive in front of you 
is also not truly her.<Delay 5>
Her consciousness is merely 
constructing this image.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:4 h:1>
!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:3>
The 'Wave Existence'...?<Delay 5>
No...<Delay 5>that's not you...!!<Delay 5>
Who are you...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:56 h:5>
It can't be...!?<Delay 5>
Is that you, Karellen!?<Delay 5>
That's right, isn't it...!?<Delay 10>
Karellen!<Delay 10> It was you who
did this to Elly!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
The 'Path of Sephirot' has
been connected.<Delay 5>
No one can stop God from
returning to his world now.<New>
So what have you come here
for, Lacan?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:54 h:3>
I came here to take the
person I love back with me!<Delay 5>
So set Elly free!<New>
The Deus' system has been
destroyed.
It's all over now!<New>
So instead I ask you...<Delay 10>
What are you hoping to
achieve now!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:5>
The time when all things
started...
The place where all things
were one...
I am going to return there!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:22 h:1>
What place?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:60 h:5>
Before the beginning of the
universe,<Delay 5> in the undulating
waves of the higher dimension,<Delay 5>
all things were one.<New>
It was the waves spilling out
from there that created this
four-dimensional universe of
ours.<New>
'Humankind'<Delay 5> and the 'Souls of
Humankind' that were born from
there,<Delay 5> are merely leftovers of
those spilled waves.<Delay 10>
So...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:50 h:2>
You're going back there?
Is that what you desired?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:54 h:7>
Lacan...<Delay 5>
Why such reluctance to
become one with God?<Delay 5>
What attachment could you
possibly have to this
wretched old world?<New>
What meaning can be found
in living out such a short
existence...<Delay 5>hurting others,<Delay 5>
hurting yourself,<Delay 5> grinding
one another down...<Delay 5>only to
inevitably die and return
to dust?<New>
Why, everything we could
ever desire is here...<Delay 5>
No need to be troubled by
the need for love...<Delay 5>
For this place is filled
with the love of God.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:54 h:3>
I have not lost hope in
humans as much as you have,
Karellen...<New>
Someday humankind will come
to understand one another!
I sincerely believe that!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:58 h:7>
How can you be so sure?<Delay 5>
Humans will never come to
understand each other.<New>
You said that she is the
person you love.<Delay 5>
But can you say that you
even truly understand
each other?<New>
All humans do is place
themselves at a comfortable
distance from each other
and call that <Delay 5>'mutual under-
standing',<Delay 5> 'spiritual unity',<Delay 5>
or<Delay 5> 'true love'<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
but it is all lies!<New>
Man cannot associate with
others without first
deceiving themselves.<Delay 5>
That is the way that they
were created.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:52 h:4>
But one being's ego can't
determine everyone's fate!<New>
People have the right to
choose their own destiny!<Delay 5>
That is why humans have
free will!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:58 h:6>
And what if that 'will'
itself was predetermined?<Delay 5>
What then?<New>
Oh, what folly!?!<Delay 5>
Humans are just primitive
life forms that have no
such things as free will...<New>
Mankind has merely been
allowed to live in an
imperfect state...<Delay 5>
"as is",<Delay 5> "as will be"<Delay 5>...<New>
It is for this very reason...<Delay 5>
because humans have this
wretched 'will' or whatnot...<Delay 5>
that humans must experience
sadness and loss.<New>
For someone to gain something
means another must lose it...<Delay 5>
It is impossible to make
humankind share limited
"things" and "affections"...<New>
So I came to the conclusion
that everything must be
reverted back to where it
all began.<New>
To go back to when all was
one...<Delay 5>
waves, and nothing else...<Delay 5>
It is not my 'Human's' ego...<Delay 5>
It is the will of the 'Waves'<Delay 5>
...the will of <Delay 5>'God'<Delay 5>...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:58 h:4>
Well that's alright, too...<Delay 5>
We don't have to be perfect.<New>
Actually, being imperfect
makes mankind live by
helping each other...<Delay 5>
That's what being human is...<New>
That's mutual understanding!<Delay 5>
That's 'unity' and 'love'...<Delay 5>
I'm glad...<Delay 5>no,<Delay 5> I'm proud...<Delay 5>
to be human!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:56 h:5>
Elly placed the future,<Delay 5>
'tomorrow',<Delay 5> in our hands,
based on our choice...<Delay 10>
And she is working to keep
Deus far from our planet.<New>
She is also trying to heal
your heart...<Delay 10>
you,<Delay 5> who wants to journey,<Delay 5>
all alone,<Delay 5> to be with God...<New>
Can't you understand Elly's
feelings!?<Delay 10>
Do you have to become one
with God before you are able
to comprehend all of this?<New>
I understand...<Delay 5>
I know her feelings...<Delay 5>
as if they were my own...<New>
Yes...<Delay 5>she and I are one!<Delay 10>
We don't need God's help!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:58 h:5>
Well then, prove it to me...<Delay 10>
Show me this power of humans!<Delay 10>
Show me this 'love',
that you say can make you
independent of God...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:18 h:2>
Fei
"Elly..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:48 h:2>
Elly
"Fei<Delay 10>...<New>
It was Karellen...<Delay 10>
Karellen released me..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"Karellen...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes. I came to understand
after becoming one with
Karellen...<New>
His heart was so full of
sadness.<Delay 5> That is why he
desired for he and I to
become one with God...<New>
Because that would be the
return to the beginning of
everything...<Delay 20>
He told me...<New>
"You should be with him..."<Delay 10>
That is what he said...<Delay 5>
You see...<Delay 5>
He already knew!<New>
Yes, he already knew...<Delay 10>
how I felt,<Delay 5> how you felt...<Delay 10>
But there was nothing we
or he could do...<New>
He had no choice but to go
forward...<Delay 5> even if it meant
he lost all feelings,<Delay 5> lost
everything that was human!<New>
For all humankind's sake...<Delay 5>
There was no going back...<Delay 5>
Even looking back held too
many memories...<New>
And he would have<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
just wanted to go back<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Even though he couldn't<Delay 5>...<New>
So please forgive him...<Delay 10>
Karellen loved people more
than anyone else..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"I<Delay 5>...<Delay 10> 
I, somehow<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
knew it all along...<New>
I just knew he was really
that kind of person..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>I am so sorry<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Please forgive me!<Delay 5>
I was wrong...<New>
I thought sacrificing
myself in order to save
others was the right
thing to do...<New>
But my actions only brought
sadness to all the people
who I left behind.<New>
And that sadness gave birth
to even more sadness.<New>
As long as 'I' still live
within you, my life is not
just mine alone."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Elly...
That isn't wrong.<New>
To sacrifice yourself for
others is a noble thing...<Delay 10>
Even if it were to benefit
yourself, it's no problem.<New>
There will always be a
person healed...<Delay 10>
One or the other...<New>
Love gains its original
shine only when there's an
interrelationship between
the giver and the receiver.<New>
It is incomplete when one
or the other is missing...<Delay 10>
The two are one.<New>
It was you, Elly, who
taught me that.<Delay 20>
I believe that is what it
means to be human...<New>
I can now understand the
true importance of it.<Delay 10>
I don't know if it's the
right answer or not...<New>
But we have a lot of time
to think about it...<New>
What Karellen himself was
looking for all along...<Delay 10>
We will find the answer to
it all...ourselves..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:26 h:3>
Elly
"Thank you...
Fei!"<Close><End of Block>
