"Elehayym Van Houten.
That incident at the Jugend
one year ago...<New>
Case 102. The release of
your latent powers from
that systematic...<New>
...administration of mental
enhancment drugs.<New>
In that instant, your Ether
value had increased beyond
400.<New>
And in that moment, 2
were critically wounded
and 3 required recycling.<New>
Am I right?"<Close><End of Block>

This wasn't the usual

Gazel Ministry.<New>
The same fate awaits that
girl, the artificial
organism.<New>
I've already taken enough
samples from her.<New>
I'm already well into the
fourth stage of my plan.
All I need now is the
final factor.<New>
Hence, your friends are
no longer of any use to
me.<Delay 30> They're worthless.<New>
But, you are different."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:52 h:4>
Krelian
"I see...<Delay 30>
So you've seen the
research facility.<New>
Presently, the Solaris
researchers are working
on genetic engineering
down there.<New>
It's just a nest for fools
who've learned the
despicable pleasure of...<New>
...playing with their own
organic creations. They
seek only serendipity and
inhumanity.<New>
That is not my place.
I specialize in
molecular engineering...
Nanotechnology."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:54 h:4>
Krelian
"Do you know what this is?
A nanomachine...a molecular
machine.<New>
This is the assembler,
which is one of those
nanomachine machines.<New>
It can break down molecules
and atoms and reconstruct
it into anything.<New>
Each of these spheres are
equivalent to an atom.<New>
Until recently, we were
only able to produce...<New>
...materials which were
several times the
size of this.<New>
Thanks to that girl, the
one we obtained from the
ruins of the Zeboim
civilization,<New>
we are now able to make it
this compact and elaborate.<New>
To think that such a
mechanism was created 4000
years ago. It's quite
astonishing.<New>
Up until we discovered
this, the work was rather
crude.<New>
The best we could possibly
do until now was to apply
amino acid solutions to
wounded areas for...<New>
...amelioration or to seal
up any peculiar abilities.<New>
I'm sure you've had some
exposure to genetics when
you were in the Jugend.<New>
Each type of those enzymes
inside the DNA...are also
molecular machines that
were created by nature.<New>
That is, if we are indeed
the progeny of the very
first organism."<Close><End of Block>

"Although the nanomachines
up until now could
recombine DNA...<New>
...they couldn't uncover
any information in the
intron which are located
in the replacements...<New>
...of the double helix.
However, the newer
nanomachines easily
discovered this data.<New>
Data that originally
'should not have existed'.
And we are about to see the
results of that."<Close><End of Block>

You were the 'mother'..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:54 h:4>
Krelian
"Yes.<New>
This is what your genetic
exon looked like before
replacement...<New>
This is the conceptualized
form of the intron which
carries information that
isn't supposed to exist.<New>
Observe. This is the
Ouroboros Ring which
contains 'intron
information' which only...<New>
...exists in 'certain
people'. Ouroboros...if
we were to anatomize such
a thing...<New>
Wouldn't you be interested
in what type of information
it would have to offer us?"<Close><End of Block>

"Elehayym, you are 
beautiful.<New>
When I look at you, I
appreciate the artistic
aspect of the human form,
its elaborateness...<New>
I can't help but feel the
importance of that.<New>
As if my molecular machine
is unworthy of you.<New>
You haven't changed
'since then'.<New>
