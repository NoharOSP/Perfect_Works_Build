"My good people of Av...<New>
This is Bartholomew Fatima,
the nineteenth King of Av,
son of Edbart Fatima IV,
the eighteenth King of Av.<New>
First, one must apologize
for the trouble caused by
one's unavoidably lengthy
absence from the palace.<New>
One especially wants to
give one's condolences to
those who lost family in
the war with Kislev.<New>
One will immediately call a
truce with Kislev and begin
reparations for the victims
in both countries.<New>
All citizens drafted as
soldiers will also be
allowed to return home.<New>
Let us work together
towards the rebuilding
of Av!"<Close><End of Block>

do hereby declare...<New>
from this day forward,
the monarchy is
abolished and all of
Av shall be a republic!"<Close><End of Block>
