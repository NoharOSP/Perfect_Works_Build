one's unavoidably lengthy
absence from the palace.<New>
One especially wants to
give one's condolences to
those who lost family in
the war with Kislev.<New>
One will immediately call a
truce with Kislev and begin
reparations to victims of
both countries.<New>
All citizens drafted as
soldiers will also be
