"They say that humans and
God lived together in a
paradise in the sky.<New>
With God's protection,
there was no fear of death
and natural disasters were
entirely unknown.<New>
Then one day, the humans
ate a forbidden fruit
which gave them incredible
wisdom.<New>
But God drove mankind from
the paradise for their sin.<New>
Bitter at having been
driven out of paradise,
humans used the wisdom they
had gained to make giants.<New>
With these giants, they
planned to challenge God
himself. But God poured
his wrath down on them.<New>
All who defied God were
destroyed.
But God himself did not
escape unharmed.<New>
Taking paradise with him,
the wounded God buried
himself deep beneath the
ocean to sleep for eons.<New>
Before going to sleep, God
used his remaining power to
create right-hearted humans
to live on this planet.<New>
These people are said to
be...<Delay 30>our ancestors."<Close><End of Block>

On the other side is an

They built the wall when

falling in from above.<New>

Thanks to that, now I
can't get through to

Maybe it happened when
you two fell in here.
Were you boys fighting
up there or something?"<Close><End of Block>

Anyway, so what can
we do about it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:54 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"It's very simple.
You just have to turn off
the sand sensor switches.<New>
Doing that will keep the
barrier from closing again.<Delay 30>
While you two are doing

<TextBlock 39 w:44 h:4>

"I've heard tales that
a Gear surpassing all
others,<New>
a 'God Gear' made in
ancient times, lies
dormant somewhere in
this world.<New>
Do you know anything
about it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:54 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"A man-made God, created
with the wisdom of God!<New>
Such a Gear would have the
power of a thousand Gears.
In a wave of its arm, it
could destroy whole cities.<New>
Its battle cries would
thunder in the heavens.<New>
You must be speaking of
the 'Omnigear'."<Close><End of Block>

Then perhaps it was what

<TextBlock 54 w:54 h:4>

buried after a great war...<New>
The gunshot marks covering
most of the Gears' armor
would appear to confirm
that."<Close><End of Block>

no records from the last
several hundred years.<New>
How about before that?"<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"None from then, either.<New>
The Church controls
all the records from
that time period.<New>
Maybe they have some very
ancient records, too...<New>

With a good Engine your

Here's a tip for when your
fuel is low: use 'Charge'
to replenish it a little

When you are fighting a
strong enemy, use 'Booster'

If you use Booster too
much, though, your fuel
