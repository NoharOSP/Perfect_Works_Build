First, there are no

I guess."<Close><End of Block>

"They say that humans and
God lived together in a
paradise in the sky.<New>
With God's protection,
there was no fear of death
and natural disasters were
entirely unknown.<New>
Then one day, the humans
ate a forbidden fruit
which gave them incredible
wisdom.<New>
But God drove mankind from
the paradise for their sin.<New>
Bitter at having been
driven out of paradise,
humans used the wisdom they
had gained to make giants.<New>
With these giants, they
planned to challenge God
himself. But God poured
his wrath down on them.<New>
All who defied God were
destroyed.
But God himself did not
escape unharmed.<New>
Taking paradise with him,
the wounded God buried
himself deep beneath the
ocean to sleep for eons.<New>
Before going to sleep, God
used his remaining power to
create right-hearted humans
to live on this planet.<New>
These people are said to
be...<Delay 30>our ancestors."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"Yes, that's it.
On the other side is an
old Av excavation site.<New>
They built the wall when
Av was excavating here
to keep the sand from
falling in from above.<New>
But they've stopped 
working there now."<Close><End of Block>

you can probably
break it down."<Close><End of Block>

No matter how good a Gear
you have, you'll never

It's much too strong.<Delay 30>
So...
let's make a deal."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"A deal?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:46 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"The barrier is closed
because the sand
sensors were tripped.<New>
Thanks to that, now I
can't get through to
the other side either.<New>
Maybe it happened when
you two fell in here.
Were you boys fighting
up there or something?"<Close><End of Block>

to tell everything!<New>
Anyway, so what can
we do about it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:54 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"It's very simple.
You just have to turn off
the sand sensor switches.<New>
Doing that will keep the
barrier from closing again.<Delay 30>
While you two are doing
that, I'll open it up."<Close><End of Block>

Ol' Man Bal
"What is it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:44 h:4>
Bart
"I've heard tales that
a Gear surpassing all
others,<New>
a 'God Gear' made in
ancient times, lies
dormant somewhere in
this world.<New>
Do you know anything
about it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:54 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"A man-made God, created
with the wisdom of God!<New>
Such a Gear would have the
power of a thousand Gears.
In a wave of its arm, it
could destroy whole cities.<New>
Its battle cries would
thunder in the heavens.<New>
You must be speaking of
the 'Omnigear'."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:52 h:4>

"You know of it? <New>
Then perhaps it was what
you were speaking about in
that tale you told us of
the battle with God..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:50 h:4>
Ol' Man Bal
"Goodness gracious,
you too, boy?<New>
Those stories were made
to inspire man's soul.
But they're just legends.<New>
Such things don't really
exist."<Close><End of Block>

a look at your Gears.<New>
It'll only take a

Argh, he's gone..."<Close><End of Block>

Gear in that story's buried
in the ground somewhere?"<Close><End of Block>

what I've heard."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"But?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"There must be some truth
in the tales that they were
buried after a great war...<New>
The gunshot marks covering
most of the Gears' armor
would appear to confirm
that."<Close><End of Block>

"You mentioned you have
no records from the last
several hundred years.<New>
How about before that?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"None from then, either.<New>
The Church controls
all the records from
that time period.<New>
Maybe they have some very
ancient records, too...<New>
All we know about our
history is from the
little pieces that we
find for ourselves."<Close><End of Block>

how the pilot handles it.<New>
First, let's talk about
the Engine.<New>
With a good Engine your
Attack Power and fuel
capacity go up.<New>
HP depends on the Frame
and Defense Ability on
the Armor equipped.<New>
Here's a tip for when your
fuel is low: use 'Charge'
to replenish it a little
as you defend yourself.<New>
When you are fighting a
strong enemy, use 'Booster'
to increase your mobility
and power.<New>
If you use Booster too
much, though, your fuel
will run out.<New>

style of fighting."<Close><End of Block>
