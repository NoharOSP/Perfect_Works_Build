    Never mind<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:56 h:29>
<Opcode 1 2>Ahem!! Actually it was a
long time ago. About fifty
years ago, an old man, Henry
Mingas, said he was taken by
the saucer and his body was
altered. Well, no one
believed him, but afterward
it's said he had amazing
knowledge and skills he
never had before.
Then ten years ago, strange
circle-shaped marks were
found in many places.
You must've heard about it.
No? Well anyway, they were
called mystery circles. So
this guy spread rumors that
they were saucer landing
sites, and when others
began to disappear, there
was even more talk. But
there were things other
than the saucer landing site
explanation, such as the
Naughty Stories, Dragon
Scrolls, or Plasma Legend.
So there was no real proof.
But real disappearances
did happen.<New>
<Opcode 1 0>Oh, I forgot to mention,
the saucer was called
'Shevat'.<New>

who worship it.<Close><End of Block>
