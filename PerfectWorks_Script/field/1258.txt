    Nevermind<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:56 h:29>
<Opcode 1 2>Ahem!!
Actually it was a long time
ago. About 50 years ago, an
old man, Henry Mingas, said<New>
he was taken by the saucer
and his body was altered.<New>
Well, no one believed him,
but afterward it's said<New> 
he had amazing knowledge 
and skills he never had 
before.<New>
Then 10 years ago, strange
circle shaped marks were
found in many places.
You must've heard about it.<New>
No? Well anyway, they were
called mystery circles.<New> 
So this guy spread rumors 
that they were saucer 
landing sites,<New> 
and when others
began to disappear, there
was even more talk.<New> 
But there were other 
things than the saucer 
landing site explanation,<New> 
such as the
Naughty Stories, Dragon
Scrolls, or Plasma Legend.
So there was no real proof.<New>
But real disappearances
did happen.<New>
<Opcode 1 0>
Oh, I forgot to mention,
the saucer was called
'Shevat'.<New>
There are even people
who worship it.<Close><End of Block>
