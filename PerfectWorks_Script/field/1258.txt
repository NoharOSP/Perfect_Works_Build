<TextBlock 15 w:56 h:29>
<Opcode 1 2>Ahem!!
Actually it was a long time
ago. About 50 years ago, an
old man, Henry Mingas, said
he was taken by the saucer
and his body was altered.
Well, no one believed him,
but afterward it's said he
had amazing knowledge and
skills he never had before.
Then 10 years ago, strange
circle shaped marks were
found in many places.
You must've heard about it.
No? Well anyway, they were
called mystery circles. So
this guy spread rumors that
they were saucer landing
sites, and when others
began to disappear, there
was even more talk. But
there were other things
than the saucer landing site
explanation, such as the
Naughty Stories, Dragon
Scrolls, or Plasma Legend.
So there was no real proof.
But real disappearances
did happen.<New>

Oh, I forgot to mention,
the saucer was called
'Shevat'.
There are even people
who worship it.<Close><End of Block>
