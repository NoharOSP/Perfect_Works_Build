It's beyond my ability
to understand, but...<Delay 10>
regardless, I'm counting
on you!<New>
No one else can do this!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:46 h:3>
We won't see each other
for a while, but I will
pray for your success!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:52 h:4>
We're gonna break up...<Delay 10>is
what I'd like to say but,
at this point, we'll stick
with you to the end!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:44 h:3>
I didn't think it
really could fly!
Who would've guessed!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:34 h:2>
(I hope I'll have
a pretty bride!)<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:34 h:2>
Let's finish them
in one stroke!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:58 h:4>
The nurse came looking for
Fei...<Delay 10>
But perhaps the nurse's care
was so bad that Fei ran away!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:2>
It's more like a monster
ship than a ghost ship...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:4>
Ghost ship...<Delay 10>
I bet it's one those things
where you get<Delay 10> blood coming
out of the showers...<New>
Watch out for the shower!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:44 h:3>
Who was that man...?<Delay 10>
I could hear his voice
echo from the hall.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:38 h:3>
What!<Delay 10>
Fei has recovered!?
That's a miracle!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:42 h:3>
Fei was a nice guy...<Delay 10>
I'll never forget
your kindness...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:40 h:3>
Elly would never do
anything like that!!<Delay 10>
I believe in her...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:48 h:5>
Elly is resting in the
medical room across from
here.<Delay 10> I bet she can't
sleep in a shabby place
like this.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:52 h:3>
Even in a foreign country,
there are people willing
to help.<New>
I bet this place has an
understanding boss.<Delay 10>
I'm so touched by it...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:60 h:5>
They blame us for destroying
Aveh's troops! I don't get it!<Delay 10>
The explosion of the Gebler
sand cruiser's reactor was to
blame, wasn't it?<New>
Even if we return to Ignas, we
are just going to be targets
for them!
This sucks!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:50 h:3>
You were on the Goliath?<Delay 10>
Hey, I tried stopping the
young master, ya know.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:48 h:3>
Professor, we have a big
job to do tomorrow! <New>
Even if you can't sleep,
you should at least lie
down!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:54 h:2>
(Actually, I'm too excited 
to go to sleep myself...)<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:40 h:3>
Marguerite's become
stronger since the
last time I saw her.<New>
She is indeed the
true Great Mother
of Nisan.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:32 h:1>
Here I go again!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:52 h:2>
We're almost at the base!<Delay 10>
Whew, finally we can rest!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:50 h:2>
I've got to work hard
for my daughter's future!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:46 h:4>
In this mission, the
Yggdrasil won't be able
to act as a lifeboat...<Delay 10>
So be careful!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:40 h:3>
I've never been so
touched since my
daughter was born...<New>
We've been through
many hardships, and
lost many friends...<New>
but I now know it
was all for a just
cause!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:34 h:3>
That Shakhan,
better have his
tombstone ready!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:34 h:2>
We must stay here
for a while...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:38 h:3>
I thought the Gear
left a while ago...<Delay 10>
Didn't it...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:50 h:1>
That was one huuuge Wels!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:38 h:3>
Ghost ship!?<Delay 10>
Yeesh, now I feel
like a real pirate!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:58 h:4>
Sigurd headed toward the
gun room with some strange
man just a minute ago...<Delay 10>
Sigurd didn't look too happy.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:42 h:3>
I see, I see,<Delay 10>
so you're alright...<New>
But I wouldn't depend
on the nurse.<Delay 10>
Ha, ha, ha!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:42 h:3>
What? First the girl,
and now Fei...!?<Delay 10>
This is horrible!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:3>
Did she lose her temper
and almost destroy the
engine room?<New>
Young girls these days
just don't know when to
stop!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:52 h:3>
Elly was acting strangely.<Delay 10>
Did she have a fight...?<New>
Being young is great.<Delay 10>
I used to be like that
when I was your age.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:46 h:3>
We're real 'pirates' at
last.<Delay 10> But, now I kinda
miss life in the sand.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:44 h:3>
Young master, it's a
great feeling to see
a renewed Yggdrasil.<New>
But it still feels the
same since we only
relocated our habitat.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:44 h:4>
Many of our friends
have passed away...<New>
We sometimes wonder if
what we're doing is
right, but someday, I
know peace will come!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:52 h:4>
When the young master
becomes a king,<Delay 10> I wonder
if they'll forget about my
bill at the bar in Aveh.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:48 h:4>
They said to stand by
inside the ship.<Delay 10>
But I want to get off at
Nisan.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:48 h:3>
Hey?<Delay 10>
That professor dressed
in green isn't with you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:52 h:4>
When will I be able to see
my daughter again?<Delay 10>
I guess I'm gonna have to
end this war first...!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:46 h:4>
My daughter is waiting
for me at the base.<New>
It's been so long since
I've seen her! So we're
going to spend a lot of
time together.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:38 h:3>
Get enough rest and
be ready for the
decisive battle!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:52 h:3>
Young master, you want to
sleep here, too?<Delay 10> Trust me,
you shouldn't do that...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:48 h:4>
Oh! Are you Rico, the
Battling Champ? I'm
originally from Kislev.
It's great to meet you!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:46 h:3>
Well, I'm no longer the
Champ.<Delay 10> So there's no
need to get so excited.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:58 h:3>
I may not be so handsome,
but I do have a fiancee
back home...<New>
but my hometown is Kislev.<New>
When the young master becomes
the king of Aveh, I wonder
if I'll be able to see her?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:50 h:4>
This is where we rest.
Do you want to rest, too?<Delay 10>
    Yes
    No thanks<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:38 h:2>
It's a little messy
so bear with it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:14 h:1>
See ya.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:34 h:3>
See you later.
Let me know when
you want to rest.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:44 h:4>
My goodness, Bart!
Where is Fei?
You had a fight again?
Oh my...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:48 h:2>
As long as you're alive,
I'll be happy.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:52 h:4>
My goodness, Bart did such
an admirable act!<Delay 10>
He used to be such a
mischievous child...<New>
When he was young he was
so stubborn! But he had a
strong sense of justice.
I'm so proud of him.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:50 h:4>
I have no idea what Bart
and you are doing, but if
something happens, I'll
back you up! No worries!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 57 w:52 h:3>
I've decided to work here,
I hope you don't mind...<New>
So, have you met my stupid
husband acting all big and
mighty in the engine room?<New>
He's got a bad mouth, but
deep down he's a good man.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 58 w:44 h:3>
I guess there are many
things in the world
I've never seen.<New>
I'll probably discover
them if I try hard
enough on my own...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:32 h:1>
Her-her-her-her!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 60 w:46 h:2>
Helen, so courageous...<Delay 10>
So moving...<Close><End of Block>
