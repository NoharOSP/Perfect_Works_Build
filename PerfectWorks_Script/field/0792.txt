If you think about how he

Citan
"Looking at the activities
of Solaris towards other
countries up until now...<New>
...it has never gone
beyond simply maintaining
their own empire, or
'self-preservation'.<New>
And as you have seen, their
military power is immense.
So Sigurd was probably
thinking ahead...<New>
First he was probably
concentrating on taking
care of the problems here
on the continent of Ignas.<New>
Once things were settled
here, it would give him
a stronger foundation to
deal with Solaris later.<New>
Which is a much better plan
than rushing straight into
a war he knew we could not
win. It's quite logical."<Close><End of Block>

Why did you leave?<New>
That Ramsus guy was
supposed to be a 'star
of hope' or something,
wasn't he?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Yes, I certainly thought
so at first.<New>
But then I realized his way
of thinking really was not
that much of a change from
the previous system.<New>
Basically, he just put the
emphasis on people's skill,
rather than on their rank
or class.<New>
The words had changed, but
it was still no different
from what Solaris itself
had been doing until then.<New>
He had no intentions of
bringing everyone a
better way of life."<Close><End of Block>

later."<Close><End of Block>

"Hmm...
I suppose so, but...<New>
Even if we were to defeat
the Geburah forces here,
there is still Solaris to
deal with.<New>
If we are not careful, it
is possible that we may get
involved in a longer war
than the one with Shakhan.<New>
Do you not agree that
continuing the way we

hard on everyone?<New>
I think it is time we
try to get help from
a greater number of
people."<Close><End of Block>
