Welcome to the Tutorial Mode.
Here you can learn more about
the 'Battling' controls.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:60 h:4>
Choose a topic to learn about
and press the <X> Button.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:60 h:8>
Battling is a game where you
fight one-on-one with Gears
in a wide-open, circular
field or arena.<Wait>
A match ends when either you
or your opponent's Gear takes
too much damage and has its
Durability (H.P.) reach zero.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:46 h:2>
The game is played on
a screen that displays
the two Gears side on.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:52 h:7>
This is the Gear you control.
You start the battle on the
left-hand side of the screen.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:61 h:12>
This is your opponent's Gear.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:61 h:16>
These are Durability Gauges
that show your damage level.
The top gauge is yours, and
the bottom is your opponent's.<New>
When you attack your opponent,
his Gear's Durability will be
depleted. The Durability in
the gauge cannot be recovered.<New>
The one who deplete's his
opponent's Durability Gauge
(H.P.) to 0 first will become
the match winner.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:60 h:4>
This is your Heat Gauge.<New>
It indicates the temperature
of your Gear, which is raised
when you use your Dash ability
or fire Ether Bullets.<Wait>
Your Gear's temperature can
be recovered also, and this
too will be reflected by the
gauge's level.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:60 h:4>
This is your opponent's
Heat Gauge.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:60 h:8>
One of these marks will
light up each time you
win a match.<Wait>
When you win a set number
of matches you will be
awarded the bout's overall
victory.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:60 h:8>
When you use Ether Bullets or
your Dash ability, your Heat
Gauge will increase. You have
to avoid heating up too much!<New>
The gauge will recover when
you're using normal attacks
or just doing nothing at all.
<Wait>
Even during your normal
running movement it will
slowly drop back down.
<New>
If you use your Ether Bullets
and Dash abilities too much,
the rate of heat recovery
won't be able to keep up...<Wait>
If your Heat Gauge reaches its
limit, your Gear will start to
overheat...
<Wait>
At this point, any further use
of such abilities will damage
your Gear and cause your
Durability (H.P.) to decrease.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:56 h:4>
When the indicator alongside
of your Heat Gauge is blue,
you can use Ether Bullets and
Dash abilities as per normal.<Wait>
But, if you use these
abilities while the
indicator is yellow...
<Wait>
your Heat Gauge will exceed
its limit and your Durability
Gauge (H.P.) will decrease.
<Wait>
When the indicator is red,
you have no Durability (H.P.)
left and so cannot fire any
more Ether Bullets.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:60 h:8>
One strategy is to attack your
opponent as much as you can
while you still have
Durability (H.P.) to spare.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 57 w:60 h:16>
To approach your opponent,
press the Directional Button
towards him/her.<New>
To retreat from your opponent,
press the Directional Button
away from him/her.<New>
Pressing Up / Down on the
Directional Button will move
you away from / towards the
screen respectively.<New>
Push the <T> Button to jump.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 58 w:63 h:10>
Hold down the <C> Button while
moving to Dash. You will run
at twice normal speed, but
your Heat Gauge will rise.<Wait>
You cannot Dash when your Heat
Gauge is at maximum or when
your Durability (H.P.) Gauge
is low.<New>
Also, your Heat Gauge will not
decrease during the time spent
in the air when you jump while
Dashing.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:60 h:9>
When you are right in front of
your opponent and you push the
Directional Button away from
him/her...<Wait>
...you can perform a Back-Dash
(momentary back acceleration).
Use this to instantaneously
dodge your opponent's attacks.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 60 w:44 h:1>
Moving while in desert areas
raises the Heat Gauge faster
than normal. Acceleration is
not as responsive either.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 61 w:54 h:4>
You cannot Dash in the water
areas. Water will also absorb
Ether Bullets, so you cannot
fire while under water.<Wait>
However, the rate of recovery
of your Heat Gauge is a little
better while your Gear is in
the water.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 62 w:28 h:8>
You can use the <S> and <X>
Buttons to attack.<New>
For example, if you just push
the <S> Button once you will
enter an attack sequence.<Wait>
<Delay 120>
If you don't push another
button in the meantime, you
will simply execute the <S>
Button's attack and finish.<New>
Now watch what happens if we
push another attack Button
before the first attack's
movement is completed...<Wait>
Either the <S> or <X> Buttons
is okay, but here we will try
pushing the <X> Button after
our initial <S> Button attack.<Wait><Delay 120>
... The <X> Button's attack
will follow immediately after
the <S> Button's attack.
<Wait>
In this way, you can enter up
to three attacks in advance,
and execute them in one swift
sequence.<New>
The type of attack changes
with the number of times
and order that the <S> and
<X> Buttons are pressed.<New>
Try combining the attack
buttons in any order that
you like. For example, <Wait><S><X><S>,<Delay 120>
<Wait><S><S><S>,<Delay 120> <Wait><X><X><S><Delay 120> and so forth.<Wait>
In all, there are 14 different
kinds of attack combinations
for you to try out.
<New>
You may input up to 3 attacks
before the first attack is
completed.<Wait>
Among your opponents, there
are Gears that can only attack
up to 2 times in sequence.
<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 63 w:48 h:2>
For long range attacks, you
can press the R1 Button to
launch an 'Ether Bullet'.
<Wait>
Ether Bullets have the ability
to track the enemy, but will
dissipate upon contact with
such things as walls or water.<New>
For each shot launched, the
Heat Gauge will rise markedly.<Wait>
If you're not careful, you
may lose all your Durability
(H.P.) by just continually
firing Ether Bullets.<Wait>
So always keep an eye on
your Heat Gauge, for fear
of losing Durability.
<New>
If your opponent fires an
Ether Bullet at you, Dash or
jump to avoid being hit by it.<Wait>
Also, if you hit your enemy's
back while he/she is fleeing,
you may be able knock him/her
off his feet.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 64 w:62 h:2>
There are times when you can't
dodge your opponent's attack
by simply moving out of the
way.<Wait>
In those occasions, it is best
to use the L1 Button to guard
against enemy attacks.
<New>
If you're about to be hit by
your enemy and you don't think
you can dodge it...<Wait>
then press the L1 Button to
take a guarding stance.<Wait>
If you were able to guard
yourself in time, the damage
from your opponent's attack
will be halved.<New>
However, you cannot guard
yourself against attacks
that come from behind you.<New>
It may be difficult to use at
first, but when you get used
to it, guarding will probably
become a useful tactic.<Close><End of Block>
