He must be stopped!<New>

Jessie
"Billy, if we merge
our Gears
together...<New>
...then we can break
through that barrier
with our combined
attack.<New>
I'm gonna borrow your
shoulder for a moment,
so start aiming now."<Close><End of Block>

Jessie
"Billy, you know
now don't you? <New>
Stein's teachings
were all a deception.<New>
That fabricated faith was
just a worldly system for
compensating those people
with fragile souls.<New>
But, faith and god aren't
things which are given to
you from others, right?<New>
They are things you
have to discover
within yourself,
and by yourself.<New>
Things that cannot
be put into words,
things that cannot
be expressed...<New>
Isn't that what god is
all about? 'Question
not thy god, for thy
god doth not respond.'"<Close><End of Block>

Jessie
"The reason I taught you
how to use a gun as a 
child was to save people.<New>
You say that guns
are just tools for
killing people.
But you are wrong.<New>
'Guns' don't kill people.
'People' kill people.<New>
Have you ever looked at
the expressions on the
faces of those Wels you
have destroyed?<New>
It is an excruciating
process to be turned
into a Wels.<New>
To ease their torturous
pain, they seek human
blood, and attack people
in order to get it.<New>
But, that does not
vanquish the true pain
within their hearts.<New>
There is only one way to
be saved from the pain.
That is by termination.<New>
Didn't all those Wels
put out of their misery
by you have peaceful
looks on their faces?<New>
Your gun saved those
people who were turned
into Wels. It's not
something anyone can do.<New>
The faith that enabled
you to accomplish that
was no deception...
God exists within you!"<Close><End of Block>

and for all, eh Stein?<New>
But, I want you to know
that you aren't gonna

That's because your
destination is going
to be hell!"<Close><Close><Close><End of Block>
