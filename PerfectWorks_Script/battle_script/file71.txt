"Billy, with a joint
attack from my Gear
and your Gear,<New>
we can break through
that barrier.<New>
I'm gonna borrow your

Jessie
"Billy, d'you see now?
Stein's teachings were
all a deception.<New>
It's just a fabricated
belief system, made to
compensate for the 
fragile human heart.<New>
But real faith and God
aren't things that are
given to you by others,
right?<New>
They are things you
discover within yourself,
and by yourself.<New>
That which cannot
be put into words,
that which cannot
be expressed...<New>
Isn't that what God is
all about? 'Question
not thy God, for thy
God doth not answer.'"<Close><End of Block>

Jessie
"I taught you about guns
when you were so young so
that you'd help people.<New>
You say that guns are
just tools for killing,
but they're not.<New>
'Guns' don't kill people.
'People' kill people.<New>
Have you ever looked at
the expressions on the
faces of those Verus
you've defeated?<New>
Changing into a Verus
is an excruciatingly
painful thing.<New>
In order to ease that
agony, they seek human
blood, and they attack.<New>
But even that can't
clear their hearts of
the true agony.<New>
There's only one way
they can be saved from
that pain, and that's
to terminate them.<New>
All the Verus you put
out of their misery...
Didn't you see how
at ease they looked?<New>
Your gun saved those
poor people who had
become Verus.
Not everyone can do that.<New>
Your faith, which made
it possible, is no
deception...
God exists within you!"<Close><End of Block>

your destination is
hell!"<Close><Close><Close><End of Block>
