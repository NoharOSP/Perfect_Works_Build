## Instructions

- Open the Xenogears: Perfect Works Patcher.
- Open the ISO file for either or both discs.

WARNING: When a ROM has been made, do not resume progress by loading a save state. As a different ROM is being used, the game will crash due to the changing of data positions. To resume a playthrough, load a hard save.

## Completion stats

- Name/terminology changes: 100%
- Main script: 89% (up to the arrival at Bethlehem)
- NPC script: Not done (except for name/terminology changes)

## Introduction

Xenogears: Perfect Works is a collaborative project aiming to make Xenogears a more complete experience. This does contain unmarked but mild spoilers, so readers are advised and warned not to scroll through this if they’re looking to use this mod to enjoy the game for the first time, or you simply never got to into it for various reasons we hope to address. These spoilers are primarily for certain story events in the story bits and lines are relegated to story specific changes and certain boss fights dungeons and all moves party members and availability are mentioned in the gameplay focused changes. 

~ Ryan (↙ ➡ ↘ ⬇ ↙ ⬅ ↘) Piccuito, character writer and handler for game balance on the Xenogears Perfect Works mod.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the patches were designed to work in tandem with each other. The 2x exp and gold patches were designed to work with the lower encounter rate patch. The monster stats and party/item patch both act as a rebalancing hack. They can be used separately from each other, but they were designed with the mindset of using them together.
